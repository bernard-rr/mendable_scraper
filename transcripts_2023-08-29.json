    "content": " In 1928, Jack Morgan is the most powerful man on Wall Street. Thanks to an era of easy money, he and his fellow bankers set loose the Roaring 20's. The stock market has climbed nearly 40% in just one year. There's a saying about JP Morgan Jr. and his partners in the late 1920's, they're called Jesus Christ and his 12 apostles, and so that gives you some sense of the stature of JP Morgan Jr. on Wall Street. Average Joe's lured by the promise of overnight riches join the frenzy, flooding the market with their borrowed money. When people see somebody making money on something, they think, that could be me too. And so when people would see the price go up in the 1920's, they'd think, well gosh, okay, you're gonna feel like a fool if you don't do it. But all of that comes to an end when the stock market crashes, plunging the entire economy into an abyss. It is the worst crash the nation has ever witnessed. For Morgan, whose fortune is cut in half, he is convinced that the only way to save his business and the country is by ousting President Hoover. He teams up with Dupont, the infamous weapons manufacturer. They rally behind a candidate to challenge Hoover's reign - FDR, an elite just like them from one of the most powerful political families in America. Morgan hopes that once FDR takes office, the president will safeguard their interests and those of their Wall Street brethren. FDR wins the election by a landslide, and his inaugural address instills hope in millions of desperate Americans. Let me assert my firm belief, that the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself. And there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business, which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callus and selfish wrongdoing. Morgan may have helped put FDR in office, but the newly elected leader swiftly turns against him, and vows to pursue the bankers responsible for the crash. As a democrat, FDR was a very skilled politician. During the campaign he blamed the crash on Hoover and promised desperate Americans a New Deal. But he was very vague about what the New Deal was. Through the enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act, commercial banks were barred from engaging in investment banking activities. The house of Morgan is forced to be broken up. It is a stunning setback for JP Morgan Jr, one he will agonize for years. The investment banking division of Morgan Bank is spun out to become an independent firm. Jack Morgan makes his son, Henry Morgan, and their business associate, Harold Stanley, partners of this newly formed company, Morgan Stanley. The house of Morgan has always thrived on leveraging other people's money, and the birth of Morgan Stanley is no different. The partners of the firm raise over $200 million dollars in debt, while investing only a fraction of their own capital, just a few million dollars. It's a great example of brand equity. They felt at ease taking on huge debt because of the Morgan name. The partnership quickly becomes the biggest Wall Street investment bank, handling over 20% of all the public offerings. FDR may have forced the house of Morgan to be split up, but the combined net worth of the new companies surpasses the wealth of the original Morgan Bank. By 1936, Morgan and FDR are sworn adversaries. But what they don't know, is that the real enemy is four thousand miles away, and he has built the most powerful military in the world. By 1939, Hitler's invasion of Poland shocks the world, showcasing Germany's unprecedented power. Within three weeks, Poland has fallen. Hitler sets his sights westward, poised to consume all of western Europe. FDR sees the threat in Europe, and understands the urgent need for America to prepare for a full-scale invasion. America's situation, as far as being prepared for fighting a modern war, was pretty abysmal. We had, maybe the 18th largest military in the world. Holland had a bigger military than we did. Hungary had a better military than we did. FDR spent the entirety of his first administration fighting corporate America, making a lot of elites very angry. He referred To Pierre Dupont as the merchant of death, and he publicly humiliated Jack Morgan by painting him as the face of the 1929 market crash. With a growing threat from Germany, FDR realizes he must do what it takes to build up America's military. And to do that, he must turn to the very people he once condemned. FDR makes an unlikely alliance with the house of Morgan, aiming to provide all the finance necessary to turn America into a military power unlike any the world has ever seen. As a part of the house of Morgan, Morgan Stanley joins forces with its' fellow investment banks, raising an impressive $5 billion dollars to fund the war effort. Morgan obviously was looking at the national interest in the context of his own, that is, saving the U.S. was an act of basic self-interest, but it was an act of nationalism. It's astonishing, isn't it? When the nation faces a common enemy, even people with great differences come together, and the whole industrial America began to operate like one giant coordinated war machine. It began at exactly 9:00 o'clock, a statement by a president Harry S. Truman in the White House, that he'd been notified by a general Eisenhower from his headquarters in Paris, that the forces of Germany had surrendered to the Allied nation. The Japanese have accepted our terms fully, that is the word we have just received from the White House in Washington, and I didn't expect to hear a celebration here in our newsroom in New York, but you can hear one going on behind me. The massive fundraising during the war helped fortify Morgan Stanley's status as the first-class investment bank. If I may be permitted to speak of the firm, of which I have the honor to be the senior partner, I should state that at all times the idea of doing only first-class business, and that in a first-class way, has been before our minds. Investment banking is a relationships business. During and after the war, Morgan Stanley deepens ties with the government, and a host of corporations. The firm is perfectly situated to launch into new heights, as the country stands on the brink of one of the most prosperous decades - the 1950's. As the 1950's roll into the 1960's, America rides a wave of economic growth, the likes of which the world has never seen. By the decades' end, the GDP more than doubles, reaching astonishing heights. At the same time, Wall Street banks experience an explosive expansion, with their assets soaring from $152 billion dollars to an astonishing $502 billion dollars. As fresh industries burst onto the scene, they turn to Wall Street, hungry for more money to fuel their dreams. Ready to seize this opportunity, is Morgan Stanley. During that time, Morgan Stanley was surprisingly conservative. They wanted to maintain their brand as a first-class business, so they chose to only work with big names, like IBM, Sony, and 20th Century Fox. While the business boomed, the partners of Morgan Stanley maintain a respectable position in the business. So, until then, money was only part of the reward for working for the firm. Prior to 1986, Morgan Stanley Partners could expect to become respectably rich in a respectable way, but not hugely, even excessively rich. By the late 1970's, a new generation of partners takes the reins as the old guards retire. But they will soon find themselves on the precipice of an impending storm. A new breed of investment bankers emerges, driven by hunger and greed, and they are on a collision course with Morgan Stanley. Salomon Brothers was established in 1910 by Jewish businessmen. Initially a bond trading house, it capitalized on the post World War One bond market boom. With an aggressive and innovative approach to finance, by the late 1970's, Salomon Brothers is emerging as a competitive force in the investment banking industry. Salomon Brothers see Morgan Stanley as an aging giant that they can take on. All they need now is just an opportunity for an opening move. By the early 1970's, IBM is the uncontested leader in technology, with its game-changing system, 370 Mainframe series. To fuel its expansion, IBM plans a hefty $1 billion dollars bond offering, traditionally a task for its' longtime partner, Morgan Stanley. Sensing an opportunity, Salomon Brothers offer IBM that they can do the bond offering cheaper and better than Morgan Stanley. Salomon Brothers were establishing themselves as an expert in the bond market. What does that mean? They had the capability in assisting companies to sell more bonds quickly and cheaply. In a startling decision, IBM chooses Salomon Brothers as the lead underwriter to issue its' debt, and Morgan Stanley just lost one of its' most valuable clients. You know, Morgan Stanley refused to give up the lead. IBM gave Salomon the go-ahead, and after that every firm on Wall Street lined up to try to unseat Morgan Stanley from the preeminent position in future offerings. Losing IBM as a client has caused Morgan Stanley to lose tens of millions in revenue. But more importantly, it strikes at the heart of their prestige. As the 1980's dawn, rival investment banks start to redefine the rules of the game, and challenge the status quo. Around that time, a lot of investment banks were growing like crazy. Bear Stearns went public in 1985, and Goldman Sachs was also able to raise almost $300 million dollars from Japanese investors. At the helm of Morgan Stanley, a new guard emerges, spearheaded by leaders like Dick Fisher and John Mack. To them, to compete with the rising competition, Morgan Stanley needs to go public. The 100 most recent new issues showed gains averaging 21.2%. The established Wall Street firm of Morgan Stanley, for instance, was among those making their debut this year, offered on March 21st, at a price of $56.50. The stock closed its first day of trading at $71.25. These companies were very smart to raise money during the peak of the bubble, because to them it felt like free money. But for Morgan Stanley, they must anticipate, prepare for the unpredictable, and soon, their foresight proves to be right. On the day of October 19th, 1987, the global stock market plunges into a free fall, the Dow Jones spiraling down an unfathomable 22.6% in a single day. While Wall Street stumbles in the chaos, Morgan Stanley stands firm. Their losses a mere bruise compared to their rivals, proving to the world once again that Morgan Stanley is a first-class business. Before the Black Monday crash, and during the first year as a public company, Morgan Stanley was actively hedging against any potential downturn, while other firms were living in the illusion that the prosperity would never end. But as the market recovers, and as a public company, the firm is forced to focus on short-term quarterly performance, which means they need consistent earnings. Either the crash shocked us, or because we became a public company, we became very, very focused on quarterly earnings. To get consistent earnings, the firm must diversify the sources of profits. As far as Fisher and Mack are concerned, there is only one way to get there. To reclaim their prestige, the top leaders at the firm decide the best path is by merging with another investment bank to expand its business reach. In 1993, they find just the target company. By the early 1990's, SG Warburg is one of the most prominent British investment banks. Founded by Jewish banker Sigmund George Warburg in 1946, the firm revolutionized finance by creating the euro bond market in the early 60's. In 1994, SG Warburg was considered England's leading securities company and represented 50 of the top 100 firms in England. One of the bank's principal attractions for Morgan Stanley was Mercury Asset Management, in which Warburg held a 75% stake. Mercury had a thriving international investment management business, and Morgan Stanley wanted to build strength in that area. The marriage between the two companies will create the world's biggest investment bank, combining the prestigious names of Morgan and Warburg. The merger looks too perfect. SG Warburg, its' investment banking business up for sale and its staff jumping ship and increasing numbers, gave bleak new evidence today of its weakened condition, saying that profits for the year ended March 31st would be well below market expectations. Hidden beneath Warburg's reputable facade are scars of financial struggle, and internal discord. And Morgan Stanley wants no trouble with them. As the potential merger goes south, Warburg has no choice but to sell itself to Swiss Bank Corporation cheaply. But Fisher and Mack remain undeterred. Their vision of transforming Morgan Stanley into the leading investment bank still holds. And before long, a new contender enters their radar -  Dean Witter. In 1997, Dean Witter is one of the largest securities firms in America. In just 12 years since 1985, Dean Witter has seen billions in explosive revenue growth, largely thanks to the success of the Discover card. Dean Witter's massive success makes the firm virtually unchallenged in retail finance. And it is all because of one man - Philip Purcell. Born in Salt Lake City, Philip J. Purcell grew during a time of optimism in the 1950's. Purcell always dreamed of becoming a successful entrepreneur. Even as a youngster, he had this hustler spirit, selling magazines and ironing shirts at a local dry cleaner. From the very beginning, Purcell had an understanding of business at a very practical level. After graduating from the London School of Economics, Purcell lands a role at McKinsey, one of the globe's top management consulting firms. But to Purcell, being a consultant is not enough. He wants to be the man in charge. McKinsey is merely his launching pad towards greater things. Before long, and by sheer chance, he's about to be given exactly what he seeks. In 1976, the struggling retail giant Sears hires Purcell to design a strategy to enhance and improve the company's performance. Thanks to his ideas, Sears makes improvements, and Purcell is hired as vice president for planning. He quickly rises through the ranks, and by 1986, he assumes the role of CEO at Dean Witter, a Sears subsidiary. Purcell is no longer just a consultant who sells advice for a living. With new found executive power, he oversees a financial company with billions in assets and tens of thousands of employees. He knows, to take the company to the next level, he needs to find a big idea - something disruptive. And before long, he sets his sights on the credit card industry. At that time, the market was dominated by American Express, Visa, and MasterCard, all of whom charged a very substantial annual fee. Purcell thinks he can do better. Instead of making revenues from interests and the annual fees, he envisions a game-changing credit card, that not only eliminates annual fees, but also offers cash back to customers. The real money will come from the transaction fees, and from merchants. That gives them some diversity in their business model, it also gives them a really stable source of revenue, at least from the processing side, very different from the credit side of the equation. This is the dawn, the dawn of Discover. The Discover card. The simplicity of the idea is brilliant, and the credit card industry is never the same. So, in 1986, Purcell became chairman of Dean Witter, and introduced Discover. In 1992, Dean Witter and Discover brought in $3.7 billion dollars in revenues, with net income of $400 million dollars. Discover's success turns Dean Witter into one of the world's most profitable and fastest growing financial service companies. For Mack at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter may just be the type of company they have been looking for. Morgan Stanley watched in awe, as Purcell capitalized on this untapped potential. He generated huge profits for both Sears and Dean Witter, and the millions of Americans celebrating their new benefits. Morgan Stanley and the rest of Wall Street got a lesson in the advantages of creating access to new markets. Since the Discover card, Wall Street has started a number of financial revolutions, and one of them is occurring as we speak. In the midst of high volatility, and a lopsided market, one company is delivering strong results for their investors, doing something no one had thought possible, just like Purcell's team. They're called Masterworks. I've invested with them for years now, and they've got a track record with a positive return of over 100%, with an exit just days ago for a 17.6% return. Masterworks is breaking open a $1.7 trillion dollar market, and like Discover, people are taking notice. Morgan Stanley themselves have studied art as an asset extensively, celebrating how it often experienced a lower price volatility, thanks to its low correlation to other asset classes. Masterworks has over $750 million dollars in assets under management, and thousands of my subscribers have invested with them alongside me. I've seen paintings sell out in minutes. But if you use the link in the description, you can skip the wait list, and receive a complimentary art investing guide right away. As Fisher approaches the retirement age in the early 90's, John Mack takes the center stage. The proposed merger with Dean Witter holds the promise of creating the world's largest investment bank, allowing Mack to potentially become the most powerful man in the industry. It is a status Mack has long yearned for since his childhood. Born in 1944 to Lebanese immigrants in North Carolina, he always dreamt of achieving great success in the business world. When he was young, he would wake up at 5:00 am during the weekends to help his father run the family grocery shop. And my father who was an entrepreneur, and he started a wholesale grocery business. My mother was a very strong force, she would only want me to be a doctor, and I really didn't want to be a doctor. My father was laid back, and my mother was really aggressive. It was a great combination. After making significant strides in Morgan Stanley, Mack quickly earned a reputation as Mack the Knife, known for his ruthless ambition, and appetite for risk. Mack knows that merging with Dean Witter will bring challenges to his position as the top dog at Morgan Stanley. But the idea of creating the world's largest investment bank proves irresistible to both firms. The Morgan Stanley group, one of Wall Street's elite investment firms, and Dean Witter, Discover, and company, which sells stocks and bonds to small investors, agreed to merge yesterday into the world's biggest securities company, in a transaction valued at $10.2 billion dollars. But in a shocking twist of fate, the board appoints Purcell as the CEO, leaving Mack as second in command. Purcell excelled as the leader of Dean Witter. But he has never run an investment bank before. Investment banking suits very well with people who are, uh, it's not good for autistic people. If you're autistic, be a trader, okay, but investment bankers are a different, it's a whole different industry, so, yeah, if you go to the symphony and look around, you'll see lots of investment bankers there. According to the employees, Purcell was a respected low profile chief executive, and an enigmatic former management consultant, but Mack was an extremely, tough, talented, brutal manager. Mack was decisive, ardent, and reacted fast. Purcell was cautious, but Mack was experienced at taking risk. Purcell knows, while there is peace for the moment, he needs to deal with John Mack soon, before Mack deals with him. Purcell strategically places his loyal allies in key positions within the firm, while maintaining an appearance of cooperation. But Mack rebels against Purcell's directives, and despises the rules imposed upon him. You have to understand that there are people who control your business, your industries, they have more power than others, they have egos, they're insecure, if you don't know how to appeal to them, if you don't know how to appeal to their self-interest, they're not going to finance you, they're not going to help you, you have to understand the political game. By the year 2000, as Phil Purcell consolidates his power, John Mack finds himself backed into a corner, isolated from influence. Until Mack has no choice but to resign. In a move viewed by Wall Street as the ultimate signal of continued hostilities, within the largest securities firm in the nation, John J. Mack resigned yesterday as president of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, and company, after 28 years there. After forcing Mack out, and having key positions at the firm filled with his loyalists, Purcell is now the unchallenged leader of the Wall Street's biggest investment bank. Despite his power at the firm, Purcell has no idea how to run Morgan Stanley. There was a clash there, and I would say it can be portrayed as a culture clash if you like, but I would say we had a serious strategic difference. People within the company wanted us to lever up more, and take more risk. At the time, I didn't agree with any of that. Purcell's strategy alienates talented employees, leading to a wave of resignations. As a result, the company's performance severely declined. But even with a firm underperforming, Purcell has built an impenetrable wall around him, and managed to fend off any attempt to remove him from his CEO position. The New York Times called Purcell ruthless, autocratic, and remote, and that he had no tolerance for dissent or even argument. He pushed away strong executives and surrounded himself with \"Yes\" men. He demanded loyalty to himself over the organization. He played power games. Purcell thinks that he can remain untouched as the CEO of Morgan Stanley. What he doesn't know, is that a new threat is emerging. The old guards of Morgan Stanley are returning, ready to launch an attack that will determine the fate of this legendary company. In 2004, Morgan Stanley finds itself in disarray, all thanks to Phil Purcell. His ill-fated attempt to integrate Dean Witter's business with Morgan Stanley has led to a steep decline in performance, and a mass exodus of talented employees. Witnessing the company they have helped build crumbling, the retired senior partners, led by Parker Gilbert, realize it's time for them to step in and rescue it. There was no dialouge, no support, technical platforms needed to be fixed, but the firm was not going forward, but was struggling like crazy to try and stand still, and in fact, was losing ground. Phil had got to go. But the problem is, Purcell has managed to consolidate power to himself so absolute, that this group of eight men have no actual voting power to oust Purcell. What they do possess, is respect and influence. Although the old guards may have retired, they still commanded a lot of respect, and wielded a tremendous amount of influence. So they began to rally employees and shareholders, urging them to unite against the oppressive leadership of Phil Purcell. Morgan Stanley CEO, Philip J. Purcell, said Monday he is planning to retire from the Wall Street investment bank amid calls for his ouster, from a group of dissident shareholders and former executives. Purcell may have had total power over Morgan Stanley, but he underestimated just how dissatisfied the employees and shareholders truly were. With Purcell's resignation, the exiled king comes back to power. John Mack is about to become the CEO of Morgan Stanley. Mack's comeback is a triumph, but he now faces a company teetering on the edge of collapse. By 2005, Morgan Stanley suffers a staggering $4.1 billion dollars in losses, with its' stock price plummeting by 50% since the early 2000's. Mack knows he needs to act fast, or the company will be no more. In the summer of 2005, everything at Morgan Stanley was an urgent priority. Replace the heads of important divisions, hire a new general counsel, sell the aircraft leasing business, and swallow the write down, move the share price up move up the return on equity, replace most of the board, which was battered, reeling, and publicly embarrassed, so forth and so on. Mack knows, the key to increased profitability, is by increasing salaries for top investment bankers and traders. He begins to encourage traders to take audacious risks, aiming for hefty profits. But to truly make a dramatic leap, Mack needs something monumental - a domain where Morgan Stanley can reignite its former glory. And in the mid 2000's, that opportunity presents itself - mortgage-backed securities. Somebody originates the mortgage, okay, that means I talked to the homeowner, I have the homeowner fill out the papers, then after they've originated the mortgage, they sell it to an investor, okay, like Fannie, or Freddie, or some private mortgage securitizer, and the private mortgage securitizer, finds a mortgage servicer, it may be the originator, who will then service the mortgage, and then we have the CMO, uh, organizer, the originator, then we have the CDO originator. It's gotten to be a very complicated financial system. To venture into the mortgage-backed securities business, Morgan Stanley acquires Saxon Capital - a specialized mortgage lender that focused on subprime loans. During this time, mortgage-backed securities were red hot. The world was on a real estate buying spree, thanks to easy loans and soaring home values. For the first time, firms, including Morgan Stanley, were buying and selling these mortgage-backed securities to and from each other. We didn't realize that this intertwining of risk held unforeseen consequences. In our hunt for more market share, we also bought companies that originated mortgages here in the United States, and in Italy, the United Kingdom, and Russia. The issuing and trading of subprime mortgage loans turns out to be a huge success. By 2007, Morgan Stanley's revenue soars to nearly $50 billion dollars, up from $34 billion dollars in 2005. John Mack's bet on MBS propels Morgan Stanley back to the top of Wall Street, alongside Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, and Merrill Lynch, as the most profitable investment banks. But what none of them realize, is that the music is about to stop, and Morgan Stanley is going to fall right back to rock bottom. Just when Morgan Stanley's resurgence seems unstoppable, an unexpected loss hits the firm. In a sign Wall Street's troubles are far from over, Morgan Stanley announced a $3.6 billion dollars fourth quarter loss, driven largely by a $9.4 billion dollars write down of mortgage-related investments. For the year, Morgan Stanley earned $3.44 billion dollars, down 62% from $9.1 billion dollars in 2006. Morgan Stanley is not alone. In a matter of weeks, the world is plunged into the worst recession in recent history. On September 15th, 2008, the unimaginable occurs. Lehman Brothers, the 4th largest investment bank in America, declares bankruptcy. Stunning reshaping of Wall Street, as the financial landscape has changed drastically in the past 24 hours. The big news here, Lehman Brothers. Unable to be rescued, has filed for bankruptcy. Mack knows, after Lehman, Morgan Stanley is next. Unless he can secure a bailout. Lehman declares bankruptcy that night. I knew that Morgan Stanley would be next in line. On Monday, our stock started down. I think we went into the week in the, in the low $30's, and probably ended up in the mid $20's after the first day. He tries to approach Japanese investors, and even from JP Morgan, but none are willing to assume Morgan Stanley's toxic mortgage assets. Out of options, Mack now fears the worst. But salvation for Morgan Stanley comes from an unlikely source - the government. I am now supporting today's financial package. I'm voting, \"aye\" today, and it may be politically damaging. I've been listening to small business people all week long and they've said, Congress has to act, we're out of options. It turns out, in order to save firms like Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, Paulson had to transform them from investment banks into bank holding companies, and this very change allowed them to qualify for government bailout. The idea was, that we would present the program to them, and ask them within a few hours to sign agreements, where they would willingly take the capital, recognizing that they're doing this for the good of the country. It turns out that Morgan Stanley may have been deemed too big to fail. With government assistance, Morgan Stanley's worst nightmare is over. The firm embarks on an incredible recovery, paying back all of the TARP money within just two years. But when you make a deal with the Fed, there is no free lunch. The public is outraged over the blatant government bailout, and demands Wall Street banks to pay up. In the years to come, Morgan Stanley, along with his Wall Street counterparts, will grapple with increased regulation, and face fines amounting to billions. With John Mack gone, James Gorman emerges as the new CEO of Morgan Stanley. James Gorman comes from a family of 11 children in Australia. He is uniquely equipped to navigate a complex organization. Gorman is less aggressive and less edgy than Mack the Knife. Him becoming the CEO is actually a turning point of the firm to move away from the risk-taking business of trading, to more of a client-facing business of asset management. To rebuild Morgan Stanley, Gorman believes wealth management is the future. Gorman sees a growing number of high net worth individuals, and is betting that after the economic recovery, they will once again need to put their money back into the market. To realize his vision for Morgan Stanley, Gorman will have to find an asset management company to acquire. By 2009, he sets his sight on Smith Barney, one of America's oldest wealth management firms. This acquisition would provide Morgan Stanley with the necessary resources to establish itself as an asset management powerhouse. But before Morgan Stanley fully acquires Smith Barney, the firm faces yet another major setback. Morgan Stanley plans to cut 1,600 employees starting this week. Two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, in the latest sign of a pullback on Wall Street as revenue from trading and deal making remains in the doldrums. Before Gorman can pursue his vision to turn around Morgan Stanley, the firm struggles to maintain profitability. To make matters worse, in 2014, the firm's reputation suffers a blow, as an employee is charged with insider trading. The arrest further complicates Gorman's mission, but things are about to change. By 2017, the U.S economy finally recovers. With the GDP climbing, unemployment dropping, and the S&P 500 soaring 40% in just three years, and more importantly, the rich continue to accumulate wealth, creating the perfect environment for the wealth management industry. Capitalizing on this growth, Morgan Stanley's money management business takes off, as Morgan Stanley experiences its most profitable year in 2017, netting billions of dollars. This timing is also critical. People, sometimes, you hear these stories about too early, too late, and if you feel the urge and you think something is missing in that marketplace, chances are somebody else out there is probably also thinking about it, so you really need to sort of take advantage of that. Seizing the opportunity, Morgan Stanley acquires more emerging investment companies. For the first time in a long time, Morgan Stanley not only regains its past prestige and market dominance, but it also transforms itself into something new. Even amid the pandemic, Morgan Stanley remains resilient, outperforming its peers. Their secret to success lies in one simple strategy - follow the money. In 2023, the firm stands trong with $3 trillion dollars in assets under management. Despite coming close to ruin multiple times, Morgan Stanley emerges stronger, more resilient, and wealthier. Yet, Morgan Stanley is but a small fraction of the enduring Morgan Empire, and it pales in comparison to the colossal entity that is JP Morgan Chase - the biggest bank in America."

    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZg0UZnaEDY",
    "content": "In the unforgiving world of Wall Street, the man poised to reshape the financial landscape of America was not a product of privilege. He's a visionary, who through relentless determination, revolutionized the way people invested. In 1905, Charles Schwab's grandfather moved from New York to California, seeking a fresh start, and soon he established himself as a respected lawyer. Charles' father, Lloyd Schwab, follows suit, and also becomes a lawyer, and eventually is elected as the district attorney for Yolo County. As a young man, Chuck feels the immense pressure to succeed, but what Chuck does not know is that he was born with dyslexia -  a learning disability not officially recognized until the 1970's. Chuck was a very strong-willed person. He would spent a lot of time after school re-reading the books, trying to translate the words on the paper to something that his unique mind could understand. Additionally, he compelled himself to read a lot of stories about successful people like Rockefeller, and JP Morgan, which further motivated him to become a really hard worker. Despite his immense efforts at school, Chuck Schwab struggles with grades. Knowing his own academic limitations, he's forced to find an alternative path to enter a prestigious college, and soon he discovers the perfect solution. Applying the same level of intensity and effort, Chuck Schwab quickly becomes one of the most accomplished young golfers in the city. His golf skill ultimately secures him a spot at a prominent university on the west coast. It's a school considered to be a life changer for almost any student at the time. Stanford University. [Music] Chuck Schwab's golf skills may have gotten him through the door at Stanford, but he quickly realizes that it will not keep him there, unless he finds a way to overcome his reading disability. During the first two years, his grades were so poor that he was on the verge of getting expelled. English I was, uh, really, slow in, so I had a terrible time in reading things. I was particularly good at math, I was sort of, advanced and all that stuff. There's so many different ways that you can solve a math problem. So, that's where it's sort of a gift to someone who is dyslexic, because they can, um, have their own way validated and it can be the right way to get there. One subject that allows him to showcase his unique strength is economics. With incredible effort, Chuck eventually graduates from Stanford's MBA program at the top of his class. But after graduation, Chuck finds himself stuck in a dead end job. I was a stock market analyst, in finance, looking at companies and trying to analyze them, so I learned from some people that were in that area, and that was my, uh, that's how I thought you could create wealth. In order to reach that level of success, like his heroes, JP Morgan, and Rockefeller, he became fixated on starting his own company. After spending only two years at Foster Investment Service, Schwab teams up with the two colleagues, and a client, to establish their own company -  First Commander Corporation. So this was the 1960's, so the market was booming, so Chuck saw there was a need for investors to have high quality, well-researched newsletters, very analogous to financial media companies like Bloomberg today. The company becomes an instant success. Within a year, they gained 3,000 subscribers, each paying $72 dollars annually for a subscription. They generate $216,000 dollars from subscriptions, which is equivalent of $2 million dollars in revenue in 2023. As the profit continues to grow, a conflict among the partners arises. Chuck wants to reinvest the earnings to expand the young business, while his partners desire to withdraw the money, and live a better life. I think one of the top three reasons businesses fail, is making bad partner choices. You really need to know your partner and your deal before you begin, which will increase your chances of success. Chuck Schwab was very growth oriented from the very beginning, and he was not going to settle at being a boutique investment research firm. Chuck knows there's only one way to resolve the conflict. He must buy out his partners. He decides to obtain a $100,000 dollar loan to purchase the shares from his partners, until he gains total control of the company. Without control over decision making, Chuck intends to focus his attention squarely on growing his company. At the age of 34, Charles Schwab is poised to become a financial titan.  But his timing to buy out his partners couldn't be worse. Following the bear market round of the 1960's, the stock market is about to enter its most volatile decade. The stock market toppled to new lows for the year again yesterday. The loss of 2.73 points in the composite index for the week was the largest since 1939, the oldest year for which it has been computed, and may have been the largest ever. As investors run scared, the last thing they want to do is pay for newsletter subscriptions. In the blink of an eye, Charles Schwab's company is decimated. [Music] Even as a company of one, Chuck refuses to give up. He knows there are always opportunities, regardless of the economic environment. He just needs to find his own. And soon he realizes the opportunity may have been staring right at him this entire time. So during a bear market, the public tends to harbor a lot of, uh, animosity towards the finance industry, so the image of a stockbroker tends to be more negative. Chuck notices a growing number of independent investors, who don't require any investment advice from their stock brokers. They simply need someone to buy and sell stocks, without asking any questions. Now, after a prolonged struggle, Chuck Schwab discovers a game-changing opportunity. He decides to launch a revolutionary type of a brokerage firm, called Discount Stock Brokers. The problem is, he's broke, and no bank is willing to extend him any more credit. So he pitches his idea to friends and family, in a desperate attempt to secure the necessary funding to bring his vision to life. I would have to go to friends for a little bit of money, I had some people at YPO who thought my business was great. Through sheer persistence, he ultimately succeeds in raising the money, allowing Charles Schwabs Incorporated to officially reopen its doors, this time, as a groundbreaking stock brokerage. Yet, despite his brilliant concept, his new business is slow to take off. After one year of operating a discount brokerage, Charles Schwab has only managed to attract 300 clients, as investors remain skeptical about this novel type of a stockbroker. The number of roadblocks that most entrepreneurs have had to, uh, deal with, would blow people's minds because they just see the success, not the grit that allowed them to keep going. [Music] Just less than five years since he started the discount brokerage business, the market begins to see the value of this new approach. His business explodes, gaining over 45,000 clients, and managing approximately $70 million dollars in assets. [Music] As the business skyrockets, Charles Schwab now has a different kind of problem. The company was growing so fast, or too fast, that it wasn't enough just to reinvest earnings - it needs more outside capital. Chuck determines that the best option is to go public through an IP. But the plan falters before he gains any traction. Charles Schwab's attempt to secure funding by going public might have stumbled, but fate has other plans in store. A prominent U.S bank has been closely observing the potential in Charles Schwab, and is about to become the solution to Schwab's problems. Bank of America. In the mid-1970's, Bank of America stands as the largest bank in the United States, with over 4,000 branches and a $100 billion dollars in assets. But, economic uncertainty, mounting inflation, and escalating interest rates led to stagnation within the bank. During this kind of environment, only a handful of finance companies are thriving. Companies, like Charles Schwab. To profit from an untapped market, Charles Schwab becomes an alluring acquisition target for Bank of America. [Music] Now working as a subsidiary of BoA [Bank of America], Charles Schwab has virtually unlimited capital to meet their needs for growth. In the first two years following the merger, Charles Schwab appears to reap significant benefits, but all of that comes to an abrupt end in 1985. As of September 9th, 1984, 55 banks have actually collapsed this year, more than during all of 1983, and the most since the last year of the Great Depression. Chuck eventually realizes that selling Charles Schwab to BoA has been a miscalculated move. Charles Schwab was a growth company while Bank of America was, a big conglomerate, that is very slow, and risk-averse, so Chuck wanted to spend more money on new technologies, but BoA was very hesitant about giving them any money. When the goals of the organization and the goals of the people who work there are in sync, that's when the magic happens. That's when a company is just firing on all cylinders. And if they're not, you're going to be upset, you're going to be pissed off. Chuck's influence over significant investment decisions is limited, leaving him unable to pursue his vision for his company. He makes a fateful decision, one that now appears inevitable. He's going to reclaim ownership of Charles Schwab from BoA. So he led a group of investors in a leveraged buyout of Charles Schwab Corporation, and the deal was valued at $280 million dollars, and most of it was debt. So, once again, Charles Schwab was betting his own fortune, just so that his company could be independent. So you had, a lot of your net worth tied up there, you also had a lot of debt ahead of you. I had all my net worth and then some [Music] Chuck Schwab knows his firm may have gained the necessary independence, but the leveraged buyout deal places the firm at a significant financial risk. He needs to reduce the firm's debt by increasing its' equity. The only viable option to achieve this is by taking the company public. The problem is, he has already tried it once, and he failed. He's uncertain if people will show interest this time around. [Bell ringing, applause] Charles Schwab raises over $134 million dollars by selling 16% stake to the public. The company finally has a healthy equity to debt ratio, and the future finally looks bright. [Music] [Music] [Crash sound] Just days after Charles Schwab's successful IPO, the financial market ground to a halt, resulting in what came to be known as Black Monday. Stock markets were in free fall around the world today. The fall on Wall Street was worse than the crash of 1929. Chuck is watching his world begin to crumble once again, right before his eyes. Due to the crash, Charles Schwab is forced to cut costs for the first time, laying off 15% of the workforce, and reducing payroll by $9.1 million dollars. Shortly after going public, we had the crash of '87. Our stock dropped from $15, was the IPO price, right on down to $6. But Chuck knows the only way to survive for any business, is by finding a new way to grow. He just needs to find that path forward. [Music] Chuck Schwab managed to reduce the risk by going public, because he understands economic cycles. Finance legends like Chuck Schwab know that good times like that of the 1980's won't last forever, as LA newspapers retroactively called 1987 \"the best and the worst year for IPOs\" These micro cycles in our economy continue today, with IPO proceeds plummeting 94% in 2022. But this time, investors like Chuck are prepared for shocks with an unexpected investment - one he's put tens of millions into throughout his career. Many people don't realize that Chuck is actually one of the top 200 art collectors in the world. In his mind, contemporary art is part of his portfolio as an asset. It makes sense, because contemporary art prices have outperformed the S&P 500, from 1995 to 2022. And amid 2022's record volatility, ultra wealthy collectors like Chuck doubled their median spending on art. But billionaires haven't bought it all up. The global value of art is expected to grow at a whopping $1 trillion dollars by 2026, almost doubling the current global value. In fact, many subscribers of this channel and myself have been investing in art for years, thanks to Masterwork's art investment platform. Masterwork's fractional approach means you don't need millions of dollars to allocate to blue chip pieces, and they have a track record of $45 million dollars in art sold so far. Every single Masterwork's exit so far has returned a profit to investors. I'm a proud investor in a Basquiat painting on Masterworks, and through the link in the description, you can skip the waitlist to invest alongside me in a few clicks. After consulting with a Boston consulting group, Chuck determines that the optimal strategy to revive his firm, is to venture into the world of mutual funds. Back in the 1990's, the mutual fund industry really took off. The industry assets went through the roof, going from $1 trillion dollars, to $6.9 trillion dollars in total assets, growing at a 20% rate per year. Leveraging their substantial customer base, Charles Schwab finds itself in an ideal position to capitalize on the burgeoning growth of mutual funds, by establishing, its own. [Music] In a year following its' inception, Charles Schwab experiences remarkable growth in their mutual fund. By capitalizing on online trading, the firm's profits soar at an astounding pace. At the height of his success, Chuck believes he has fulfilled his dream of constructing a financial empire, akin to those of JP Morgan and Rockefeller, and the time has come for him to retire. David Pottruck, previously serving as the company's president, steps up as Chuck Schwab's successor. With the high standards set by Chuck, Pottruck is determined to elevate Charles Schwab even further, while preserving the success that Schwab already has. But during a bull market like that of the 1990's, it was easy to perform well, so Pottruck started a lot of initiatives that seem to have some success. For the time being, Pottruck excels as CEO, with the company continuing to accumulate substantial profits amid the internet boom, fueled by an unparalleled influx of retail investors. But no prosperity can last indefinitely. For Pottruck, the true test of his leadership is just around the corner. ...what they are already calling Black Friday. It was the worst single day point loss ever for both exchanges. After the burst of tech driven bubble, Charles Schwab's fortunes waned, with revenues and profits plummeting, and a stock price spiraling from $50 per share, to below $10 dollars per share. The dot com bust led Pottruck to recognize the necessity of safeguarding the company's core business. He believes the only way to do that, is by diversification. Within just a few years, the company expands into various new sectors, including launching a bank, and an institutional trading department. But as a result of his over diversification, the profitability and growth of the company have declined severely. By the early 2000's, Charles Schwab became this sort of, big conglomerate mess of enterprise. A lot of divisions were barely profitable. Recognizing the need for a change in direction, the board turns to the one man they believe could turn the tide -  the company's founder, Chuck Schwab. [Music] Charles Schwab Corp, the famed San Francisco discount broker that has struggled since the dot com bust, abruptly dumped chief executive officer David Pottruck this week, replacing him with the 66 year old founder who shares the company name. Chuck knows the key to reviving Charles Schwab lies not in diversification, but in focusing on growth and improving client service. His story is very analogous to Steve Jobs returning to Apple, so he cut a lot of departments and product lines, and made the company really focused on user experience. Upon Chuck's return, the company experiences a dramatic transformation. Revenues begin to climb, and by 2005, profitability is restored after years of losses. The market rallies around Schwab, driving the stock price from a modest $7 dollars per share in 2002, to over $20 dollars per share by 2006. [Music] Having rescued the firm, Chuck Schwab retires one last time, passing the CEO title to Walter Bettinger. For Bettinger, the future appears bright. Confident in his ability to avoid Pottruck's pitfalls, he prepares to steer Charles Schwab to a new era. [Music] Mere weeks after Walter Bettinger assumed the CEO of Charles Schwab, the company finds itself plunged into the depth of the most devastating financial crisis in recent memory. They allowed fucking women and men, who worked hard to buy their home... As the crisis deepens, Charles Schwab's becomes one of the most vulnerable firms on Wall Street. It's yield plus fund, that was heavily invested in mortgage debt, collapses within a matter of days. But to make matters even worse, the crash of the yield plus fund draws the attention of the SEC, making Charles Schwab a target of regulatory punishment. [Music] As a new CEO of Charles Schwab, Walter Bettinger is in trouble. The company's revenues plummet, experiencing a staggering 20% decline from 2007 to 2008. But Bettinger is determined to revive the firm, and to avoid suffering the same fate as Pottruck. He will spend the next five years trying to rebuild Charles Schwab. But to truly regain its past glory, he needs to do something groundbreaking. He knows the only way to save Charles Schwab is by focusing on growth and rebuilding the client's trust. Bettinger realized that Charles Schwab made a grave miscalculation with mortgage-backed securities, and he needed to make sure to avoid that type of risk again. In 2015, Charles Schwab launches Intelligent Portfolios, becoming one of the earliest pioneers of robo-advisors. Bettinger hopes by utilizing algorithms, the risks associated with the portfolio could be better understood and managed, ultimately providing superior service to clients. [Music] I would tell people to buy Schwab! Now he bought a lot of stock, he became one, and that now he's a terrific guy, he's a brave guy. For 2015, Charles Schwab witnesses a staggering ascent, with SS owner management skyrocketing for $2.4 trillion dollars, to an impressive $6.7 trillion dollars in 2020. Meanwhile, the active brokerage accounts tripled, surpassing $30 million, as innovations like Intelligent Portfolios captivate a new era of investors. As is the case with a lot of big companies, the growth is not necessarily organic anymore. For Schwab, it came from acquisitions like USAA and Street Smart. Thanks partly to Walter Bettinger, Charles Schwab becomes the undisputed king of stock brokerages. Its' sheer scale and power have effectively kept its' competitors at bay. What none of them realizes, is that the biggest challenge will emerge from the most unexpected places imaginable. [Music] [Bell ringing, applause, cheering] [Music] Now you wanna know what disruption really looks like? Well you're looking at it! I think it's Robin Hood. It's the privately held operator that launched its' commission free brokerage platform in 2015. This company has been growing like a weed - 10 times since we saw them last in 2016. Robin Hood rapidly amasses a growing user base, seemingly appearing out of thin air. Baiju and Vlad embody a new era on Wall Street, where young visionaries achieve the mpossible, through innovation and resourcefulness. Using Robinhood is less like using a traditional financial product where you have paperwork, you have to wait, it's more similar to using a technology product like an Uber or an Instagram. This rise was fueled by a surge of novice investors, and heightened demand for online trading, amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic. By the year 2020, Robin Hood has gained over 13 million account holders. For Bettinger, every client that Robin Hood gains is a potential loss for Charles Schwab. Sensing the urgency, he realizes that the time has come for his company to strike back. Well the investing world rocked last week when Charles Schwab announced the firm would go to zero commissions on equities and ETFs. Removing the trading commission would cause a temporary revenue setback for Charles Schwab. Investors don't see it as good news for the industry. Shares of Schwab fell sharply today, so did rivals like TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, and Interactive Brokers. Bettinger is betting that Charles Schwab's quality service and better infrastructure will convince people to choose it over Robin Hood. But by sheer coincidence, Robin Hood is about to make a grave mistake, and play directly into Bettinger's hands. [Music] Underemployed, sitting at home, using the power of the internet to destroy the kings of American finance. We have seen a massive surge in the stock price on the company called GameStop. In early 2022, a short squeeze on the struggling retailer GameStop's stock unfolds as amateur traders from Reddit's Wall Street threads defy Wall Street hedge funds. As share prices soared, platforms like Robin Hood halt trading, citing volatility and regulation concerns. Critics accuse them of favoring hedge funds over retail investors by limiting participation in the market surge. Okay then and we do have now some statements from Robin Hood and interactive brokers about restricting trading. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only... [Music] To Bettinger, Robin Hood's stumble is a golden opportunity to assert Charles Schwab's dominance. Looks like you can still buy GameStop at Charles Schwab so there you go there's GME, the price right now $390. Although firms like Charles Schwab eventually began to limit trades on GameStop, most of the blame for the public falls on Robin Hood. Driven in part by the surge in retail trading during the pandemic, Charles Schwab added 5 million brokerage accounts in 2020. To further solidify their position, the regulatory authorities finally approved Charles Schwab's acquisition of TD Ameritrade - the project that was initiated in 2019. Overnight, Charles Schwab's clientbase almost increased by 50%. With twice as many broker clients as Robin Hood, Charles Schwab stands tall as the industry leader. [Music] But in 2021, Charles Schwab remains a hungry financial giant, with over $7 trillion dollars under management. To me the biggest lesson from all of it is, your performance or the performance of your organization, isn't determined by what happens to you. It's determined by how you lead, the choices you make, the behaviors you break, and that even in extreme environments, that's true. While Chuck Schwab laid the foundation for this legendary firm, his successor Bettinger has proven instrumental in its' lasting legacy. Yet, the future of Charles Schwab is still uncertain, as rivals like Robin Hood rise, the company must adapt and innovate to maintain a supremacy in the ever-changing world of finance, where even giants can perish in mere days. The struggle for continued prosperity and survival for Charles Schwab has only just begun. [Music]"

    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwxe0lLaDs",
    "content": "After winning a hostile takeover battle against Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett now fully controls the textile company. But he quickly realizes that he has made a grave mistake. Part of the partnership was buying, what looked like cheap stocks, Berkshire Hathaway looked like a cheap stock. It wasn't a very - it was a terrible business. The textile industry is headed towards an inevitable decline. Buffett's ownership of the company is bound to be worthless. Unless he can find someone else to buy it. He turns to his trusted friend, Charlie Munger, for help, offering to sell him Berkshire Hathaway pennies on the dollar. But Munger declines his offer. Instead, he shows Buffett another way out. He presents a new company to Buffett, one that has the potential to change Berkshire's fortunes. The company is called Blue Chip Stamps. Blue Chip Stamps sell stamps at a discount to store owners and marketplaces. These stamps are then given to customers as rewards. Since customers collect stamps to redeem for rewards at a later time, Blue Chip Stamps holds on to a substantial amount of cash, known as float. For Buffett and Munger, having access to the float will be advantageous. Blue Chip Stamps is kind of like an insurance company - having a large amount of cash can potentially give Buffett and Munger the opportunity to invest the funds in other companies. Buffett and Munger keep buying the shares of Blue Chip Stamps, until they have full control of the company. [Music] With his investment in Blue Chip Stamps, Warren Buffett has extended a lifeline to Berkshire Hathaway. But it's not nearly enough. To truly save Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett knows he must take decisive actions. He knows it'll be a daunting task, something he can't do if he's under constant pressure from the partners of his fund. Then, Warren Buffett does the unthinkable. In order to free himself to pursue his vision for Berkshire Hathaway, he shuts down his investment partnership. [Music] For over a decade, Warren Buffett has amassed a fortune for his investment partners, achieving a remarkable annualized return of 23% over 13 years. And from the dissolution of his partnership, Buffett finds himself with a staggering $16 million dollars in cash. It's the type of money he will use to rebuild Berkshire Hathaway. Determined to not only save Berkshire Hathaway, but to transform it into an empire, Buffett goes all in, investing the majority of his net worth into the company that will become his legacy. It's a gamble that would define his career, and reshape the world of finance forever. It's really remarkable because Buffett was again going against what Ben Graham has taught him, which was to avoid taking on too much risk, but I think what he was really doing was betting on himself. He has so much confidence in his own ability to turn Berkshire Hathaway into a major success, that he was willing to put all of his money into the company although it was facing bankruptcy. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] To save Berkshire, Warren is pinning his hopes on cash flow generating companies like Blue Chip Stamps. But in spite of his seemingly infallible plan, Buffett and Munger's investment in Blue Chips is also turning into a catastrophe. Blue Chip Stamps is accused of colluding with other stamp companies to stifle competition, and impose unjust restrictions on merchants. The Supreme Court rules against them, allowing private parties to sue for anti-trust violations. Blue Chip Stamps now faces a decline in profit margins. It's a threat to their competitive advantage. For Munger, who's managing a fund for his partners, the fate of his career rests on the success of Blue Chip Stamps. In a desperate attempt to make up for the potential losses, Munger and Buffett are on a hunt for another company to acquire - one that has stable earnings that can provide a cushion for Blue Chip Stamps' declining business. And it turns out a small candy store located out in Los Angeles may just be the solution to their problems. [Music] In 1971, See's Candies is the most popular store in the West Coast. So basically, Buffett and Munger were looking for companies with enduring competitive advantage - they call it a moat - and they found what they're looking for in See's Candies. If you've got a economic castle, people are going to come and want to take that castle away from you, and you better have a strong boat, you better have a knight in a castle that knows what he's doing. With it's unwavering popularity, See's Candies boasts a consistent stream of earnings. [Music] Recognizing the potential for stability among volatility, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger seized the opportunity to acquire See's Candies with the cash from Blue Chip Stamps. And to make sure Sees Candies' success continues, Buffett and Munger become personally invested in the business, taking a hands-on approach to its' operations. They go so far as to launch a legal defense against competitors seeking to copy the candy store's success. [Music] The acquisition of See's Candies proved to be a monumental success, propelling the business to thrive for the next 60 years, generating billions in profit. But by the mid-1970's, Buffett and Munger's firms are still barely surviving. But they have found a way to keep their companies afloat; by acquiring other cash flow generating companies. Buffett and Munger love insurance companies because they generate stable cash flows that can be used to invest in other companies. And soon they began looking for a different kind of company but has the same business model. In 1973, Munger and Buffett discovered Wesco Financial, a savings and loans holding company, in Pasadena, California. But a bidding war ensues, pitting them against the Financial Corporation of Santa Barbara - a company with greater resources. Despite the challenge, Buffett persuades the owner to sell Wesco to him and Munger. The announcement causes Wesco stock to plummet, from $16 to $11 per share, presenting an opportunity for profit. Instead of taking advantage of the situation, Buffett and Munger decide to purchase the stocks at $17 per share - foregoing $5 per share of potential profit, due to their sense of integrity. Now with Blue Chip Stamps owning over half of West Coast Financial, Munger assumes the position of chairman for the newly acquired company. The future of Berkshire is finally looking up, as Buffett's ownership of numerous cash generating businesses mitigates the impact of a declining textile industry. Ironically by trying to save both of their firms, they stumbled upon a very ingenious business model. This model involves purchasing companies with a lot of cash reserves, or floats, and then utilizing the funds to purchase other companies. But Buffett and Munger's victory is short lasted. Their unique approach to business attracts the attention of the SEC, and a tough prosecutor who's ready to come after everything Buffett and Munger own. [Music] The stock market toppled to new lows for the year again yesterday that concluded one of the most adverse weeks in Wall Street history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 15.57 points to 922.19. After the market crash, Berkshire's stock drops in half. During a bear market, the SEC tends to face a lot of pressure to calm the public's frustration, and they tend to increase their efforts in prosecuting companies and individuals. A formidable up-and-comer in the SEC is on his way to becoming one of the toughest prosecutors in the government. Stanley Sporkin has been looking into Buffett and Munger's takeover of Wesco Financial. Sporkin could not understand why Buffett and Munger would overpay for a deal when there's a clear opportunity to make a profit. Sporkin, with a keen eye for deception, suspects that Buffett and Munger have constructed a complex web of acquisitions and business dealings to conceal their illegal activities. For Buffett and Munger, who value their reputation more than anything else, the potential of getting indicted is their worst nightmare. [Music] In the end, the very thing they're afraid to lose, ends up becoming the thing that saves them. Buffett and Munger have cultivated an impeccable reputation among their business associates, meeting many of them to come to their defense. In fact many individuals have come so far as to contact Stanley Sporkin to vouch for Buffett and Munger, and plead with him to not indict them. Ultimately, the substantial support extended by the colleagues and associates of Buffett and Munger, successfully persuaded the SEC to abstain from pressing charges against them. Their reputation is intact, and their business is back to usual. Buffett evades catastrophe with his reputation intact. For years, he has been steadily acquiring newspaper companies including, the Washington Post, but now, more than ever he's convinced of the long-term value of owning media companies. He's ready to go big. Buffett really liked media companies. I think it's because he understands the power and influence of media. In a groundbreaking move, Buffett acquires Buffalo Evening News, for a record-breaking $35 million dollars, a daily newspaper tailored to conservative readers. But Buffett doesn't stop there. He realizes the complexity of his investment deals has gotten him into trouble. Time has come to consolidate businesses. After years of struggling to revitalize the textile department, Buffett makes a decision that is all but inevitable. He shuts down all textile mills. And to further streamline the business, Buffett and Munger merged Berkshire Hathaway with Blue Chip Stamps, and employed Munger as vice chairman. And finally, the new Berkshire Hathaway is born. Step by step, but we've created something that kind of what I dreamt we might create over time, but it took, it took a lot of time to do it, never seemed like we were making that progress, much progress on it in one day, but, compound interest works. And with the dawn of a new decade, Buffett and Munger cemented their partnership, and discovered a business model that will propel their snowball to epic proportions, securing their legacy for decades to come. In the 1980's, the U.S economy reaches unprecedented heights, and Warren Buffett's business is no exception. Through strategic acquisitions of firms, like the Furniture Mart and ABC News, Buffet has elevated his business to new levels. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway stock has soared to $2,000 dollars per share, making Buffett a billionaire. Warren Buffett of Omaha, Nebraska. If you would've put $10,000 dollars in 1965 into his company, Berkshire Hathaway, you would have $1 million today. In general, Buffett's investment strategy is very event driven. He typically invests in a company when there was a catalyst, like a lawsuit or a takeover. However, the 80's is also characterized by culture of the corporate raiders, and of junk bond financing. Despite this environment, Buffett manages to avoid getting caught up in the fray. Whenever he engages in takeover deals, he always appears as the white knight, the one companies turn to for help in fending off hostile takeovers. [Music] But despite his soaring net worth and fame, Buffett struggles to find attractive investments. All things being equal, a high level of optimism will cause things to be priced high relative to their fair value, or what we call the intrinsic value. So we have to figure out the intrinsic value, but clearly, in a period of great optimism regarding the future, prices will tend to be high relative to the intrinsic value. And I'd like to buy when the price is below the intrinsic value, and sell when it's above. Under the pressure to outperform, Buffett does the unthinkable. He invests in a Wall Street firm, the Salomon Brothers. [Music] Many years back when Warren Buffett was trying to turn around Geico, Salomon Brothers was the only Wall Street firm willing to underwrite bonds for the company. So Buffett thought to himself, this could be a good company to invest in. Salomon Brothers started as a bond trader in 1910, and came to prominence during the roaring twenties. In 1985, the firm made a profit of $500 million dollars, establishing its' position as one of Wall Street's most profitable companies. Warren Buffett sees Salomon Brothers as a great business, with an excellent management team in place. Despite this, he believes the company is overvalued. But the oracle of Omaha still manages to find a way to profit from the situation. He presents Salomon with a proposal. If they want his money, they must create a security for him that guarantees a 15% return. You see what he did there? Buffett was leveraging his brand in exchange for riskless profit. He was almost acting like DJ Khaled. You can use my name, but for a fee. For Salomon Brothers, having Buffett as an investor is a huge boost of confidence for the company's stock. They managed to create a preferred stock that is designed specifically for him. This security would generate 15% return for Buffett in the long run, but with an unlimited upside, should Salomon stocks soar. And Buffett buys $700 million dollars of them. I would like to say that Berkshire Hathaway was a large customer of Salomon long before we bought the preferred, and that we've had marvelous service over the years. I think Salomon's going to be around for a long time. So in this scenario, the only risk Warren Buffett has is that Salomon Brothers goes bankrupt. But that event is just virtually impossible, right? [Music] Good evening, the stock market today crashed, the Dow Jones Industrials, every other major index breaking records in its, uh, plummet downward. On October 19th, 1987, the world watches in shock as the stock market crashed in what became known as Black Monday, with billions of dollars evaporated. Buffett watches as Salomon Brothers begins to crumble. For the first time, he starts to worry that a bankruptcy of Salomon is becoming likely. But the crash also presents an opportunity for Buffett to invest in a company that he has been watching for a while - Coca-Cola. For many many months, we were buying as much Coca-Cola as we could buy, roughly a third of the volume trading, every day for months. We were very aggressive in buying into Coca-Cola. Buffet's name and status also allowed him to buy Coca-Cola without disclosing it to anyone for more than a year because SEC gave him special privilege to withhold that information. Warren Buffett continues to leverage his unique brand to get special deals, from companies such as Gillette, that he obtained a 9% preferred stock. As the shares of Salomon Brothers make a remarkable recovery following the Black Monday, Warren Buffett thinks the worst is behind him. Little does he know, the storm is far from over. This is NBC Nightly News. Good evening, it is the kind of scandal that rocks Wall Street and raises questions. Questions about the integrity of our financial institutions. For the giant securities firm of Salomon Brothers under investigation for improper trading of treasury bonds. Ultimately like many other Wall Street firms, Salomon Brothers was like a casino. It had one of the largest bond trading departments in the world, but that department was known for its aggressive trading strategies and risk-taking appetite. When bond trader, Paul Moser, is found to have manipulated a treasury auction to make a huge profit, Salomon Brothers' reputation is severely damaged. In finance, losing reputation means losing confidence. Within weeks, the company is on the verge of bankruptcy. Salomon Brothers is under investigation by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Justice Department, but more important than the fate of the firm itself, is the impact their actions could have on the public trust, and on the credibility of the American market worldwide. And its CEO is desperate to restore the public's trust. He's hoping there's one man that can help boost the confidence of the market, and if he says Salomon Brothers is fine, maybe other investors will follow. Buffett is called upon to save Salomon Brothers. But instead of engaging in a legal battle, Buffett takes a completely different approach. He turns Salomon Brothers inside out, making the company completely transparent to the lawmakers, and giving prosecutors access to any and all documents. I would do whatever was needed dig out any bit of information about what's happened in the past, and would do everything I could to make sure that things are exactly right in the future. This move is designed to show the public and the government that Salomon Brothers has learned from its mistakes, and will be an honest institution going forward. Buffett knows this may be the only way to prevent Salomon Brothers from going bankrupt. But it's more important that he preserves his own reputation. And to do that, he needs to be on the side of the people fighting corporate greed. Buffett's crusade to eradicate any bad apples in the company results in Salomon Brothers being reduced in size, and many\n501\n00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,.440\nemployees lose their jobs. And more importantly, Buffett's investment in Salomon Brothers remains intact. So, the Treasury modified its' order, and in effect, of course, it was quite an endorsement, it was huge. Buffett has turned a pretty nasty situation to his favor. He was able to use the opportunity to reinforce the image that he is the conscience of American finance. With the salvation of Salomon Brothers, Buffett's business soared, making him the richest man in America. And with that momentum, he buys the rest of Geico, as insurance companies continue to be his biggest cash cows. After all, Buffett's #1 rule is to never lose money, and the $700 million dollar bet is a quarter of Berkshire Hathaway's entire portfolio at the time. But we'll see that Buffett learns a valuable lesson - one still serving him well in 2023, as we're grappled with mass layoffs, inflation, and now, bank runs. Unsurprisingly Warren Buffett maintains a cautious approach, holding a sizable $130 billion dollars of cash, almost 20% of his total assets. Now from Buffett, to retail investors, all seek to safeguard and expand their wealth, leading top financial institutions like Goldman Sachs to invest billions in real assets, and recommend them to their key clients. In fact, in 2022, amid the stock market's worst year since 2008, one real asset's prices surged by 29% on average according to Barons. That asset? Museum quality multi-million dollar fine art. That's why since 2021, I have been investing with a company called Masterworks that offers investment in art from legends like Picasso, and Banksy. While previously only accessible to high net worth individuals, Masterworks manages everything from acquisitions, to sale, and they've already exited 11 paintings, all of them for a profit. In fact, their last three exits returned net profits of 10%, 13%, and 35%, directly to investors like us. With the contemporary arts low correlation to stocks, and attractive historical appreciation, I'm happy that I've been invested with Masterworks, and with my link in the description, you can skip the waitlist and join me. [Plane taking off] Fueled by technological innovation and globalization, the mid-1990's in America were a time of a great economic growth. For the newly crowned America's richest man, it's not necessarily good news. An overheated stock market means fewer investment opportunities. But Buffett ultimately succumbed to the pressure and temptation to invest. He acquires a giant insurance company called General Re, for $22 billion dollars. He paid for it using Berkshire Hathaway stock. It's something Buffett has never done before. In my experience, most deals where equity is offered as the primary source of consideration, seller accepts that because they believe that there's significant upside to that equity. Acquirer insists on that because they think the marketplace is probably overvaluing the equity. Buying something with stocks could be interpreted that Warren Buffett thought Berkshire Hathaway was too inflated. But buying the company during the height of the dot com bubble is going to be a mistake that Buffett comes to regret. [Music] Stocks ended mixed, as Coca-Cola joined the list of companies warning that profits would not meet forecasts. Earnings growth expectations have just been too high, said Robert Natali, a portfolio manager at Bear Stern's Asset Management Inc. Admist the turmoil of a scandal that sent Coca-Cola shares plummeting, Warren Buffett's recently acquired company, General Re, also faces a disaster of its' own. In 1999, the company was defrauded out of a staggering $275 million dollars, jeopardizing Buffett's investment, and threatening to undermine his reputation as one of the world's most successful investors. As the bull market charges ahead, producing new millionaires at a breakneck pace, Warren Buffett's legendary investment record appears increasingly ordinary. To make matters worse. Buffett's personal life takes a dark turn. In early 2000, Buffett finds a tumor in his colon, and is hospitalized for surgery. While Buffett recovers from the surgery, the stock market takes a nosedive, and the dot com bubble finally bursts. It's after what they are already calling Black Friday. It was the worst single day point loss ever for both exchanges. After the dot com bubble, Buffett's reputation revives. He's now ready to re-enter the game, and start scouting for companies selling at a discount. But there's a problem. Less than two years after the dot com bubble, another major disaster hits the American finance industry. 9/11 was particularly bad for Warren Buffett, because guess what? He owned a lot of insurance companies that had to pay billions in damages. Good evening everyone, the Dow ends its worst week ever, with another triple digit loss. The NASDAQ fell 47 today. It was another volatile day with huge price swings for the Blue Chips, as investors pondered the implications of President Bush's address to the nation last night. The 9/11 attacks shook the economy, but Buffett is determined to make a comeback. He sees an opportunity to buy companies at a steep discount, including the McLane company, and Business Wire. As Buffett's investment portfolio begins to bounce back, by 2005, Buffett is back on the top of the business world again. It's a status he's achieved through years of business acquisitions and brand building, and soon his name and his brand will be used to save Wall Street, yet again, from an impending financial catastrophe. The most expensive stock in the United States passed an unusual plateau yesterday, as the price for a Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. briefly surpassed $100,000 dollars. In 2006, Warren Buffett's investment in Gen Re finally becomes profitable, bouncing back from earlier struggles. But Buffett senses that the market is overheated, and struggles to find new profitable investments. Terrific game that way because you can sit there and wait, and wait, and wait for the right pitch, and, and there are not many things in life where you get that option. And that's exactly what you're doing now. That's, that's what I do now. I've done it before. In anticipation of this annual meeting, you have to say to the stockholders, I've been waiting for the right pitch, and I haven't seen it. That's right, that's right, and, and some pitch somebody else can hit out of the park, you know, but I don't think I can, you know, that's my, that's, uh, my problem but I'm not gonna, you know, I'm not gonna think I can hit a pitch I can't. But what he doesn't know, is that a cataclysmic economic event is just two years away. Poised to unleash financial destruction on a scale that is unheard of. Everyone else is watching and they're seeing these big negative numbers and their confidence gets affected. Right now we're sitting down 875 points. We've now broken down 10,000. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 900 points. As the housing crisis deepens, Wall Street's once impregnable fortress begins to crumble. One of the industries most legendary firms suddenly finds itself on the precipice of ruin. Desperate to restore confidence in the market and fend off financial disaster, Goldman Sachs turns to Warren Buffett. [Music] You know, from our standpoint with, we've, we've had a lot of cash, we now are seeing things that, you know, give us a chance to use that cash sensibly, and, and this was a, a $5 billion dollar opportunity to I think deploy cash sensibly. While billing out Goldman Sachs, Buffett makes sure he gets a favorable deal from the bank that guarantees him a huge profit once the firm survives the crash. He employs the same strategy with General Electric, investing $3 billion dollars in preferred stock that offers unlimited upside and no downside. 2008 was one of the best periods of time for Warren Buffett. He invested in a lot of troubled companies, and even in distressed debts. Berkshire Hathaway was so invested, that he ran out of cash for the first time ever. While the housing crisis of 2008 becomes a thing of the past, the American economy has seen a remarkable resurgence, with the market experiencing one of the longest periods of prosperity. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have soared to incredible heights, but now Buffett has a new problem. Warren Buffett has talked in the past or spoken about in the past, um, the difficulties of Berkshire Hathaway becoming so large. He says that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find businesses that he can purchase or invest in that will move the needle in a dramatic fashion for Berkshire. In 2016, his attention was drawn to an unexpected company - Apple - a long-standing avoided investment for Buffett. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has taken in a $1 billion dollar stake in Apple. According to a regulatory filing report released today, Berkshire held almost 10 million shares of Apple in its first quarter. The company is possibly betting that the tech giant will rebound after a slowdown in iPhone sales. Despite his large investments in behemoth companies like Apple, Berkshire Hathaway's stock price remains stagnant. If you look at Berkshire Hathaway's stock price for the past 15 years until 2022, it behaved very similarly to the S&P 500. For the past five years, Buffett has been content to sit on the side lines, and observe the market's unprecedented boom, driven by retail investors and cryptocurrencies. But after years of going through market cycles, Buffett and Munger are convinced that the time will come for the market to fall. [Music] Well we start off by bidding adieu to 2022 with a big good riddance. Major averages all officially closing out the year with their worst losses since the financial crisis. The NASDAQ down for four straight quarters for the first time since the dot com bust. As the year 2022 draws to a close, the financial world is on the brink of a reckoning. The market has faltered, and the S&P 500 has plunged by a staggering 19% from the previous year. At the same time, the once booming cryptocurrency market is cut in half, leaving investors reeling, and unsure of what the future holds. While the rest of the market struggles to stay profitable, Buffett and Munger see the opportunity they have been waiting for. [Music] Over the course of eight intense months, Buffett and Munger make bold moves, investing in major companies such as Activision Blizzard and Celanese. One should not just listen to what Warren Buffett says, but actually study what he does. I think what Warren Buffett does better than a lot of other investors is that he put in a lot of effort into building a brand, and that brand helped him make outsized returns that other investors simply just can't do. He has such a status, that he can move the market with his words alone. With his unparalleled ability to steer the course of markets, Warren Buffett lives up to his name. The oracle of Omaha.

    "content": "It's the dawn of a new century. After two decades of economic boom, the American finance industry is more prosperous than ever. Leading this explosive growth is a new type of company, that just 20 years ago was totally unimaginable - Vanguard, the nation's first and largest index fund. The captain of Vanguard is a man with unlimited ambition, who through sheer force will build a financial empire. He created an institution that was pro-customer, I just loved him. He democratized investing for individuals, which was a huge contribution in the mutual funds space. Jack Bogle is pretty much like a T-Rex, in terms of what Vanguard is, you don't see too many folks anywhere in the world that manage that much money. [Music] John Bogle is born into a wealthy family. His father was a decorated pilot during World War One, and now has a high-paying job for the legendary company, American Can. The Roaring 20's is a decade of unprecedented prosperity. During the Roaring 20s, there was the sense that you can't lose. People everywhere seemed to get wealthier. The stock market in the 1920's became a retail market in a way it had never been before. When the people heard that their neighbor had doubled his money in the market, and then doubled it again you started to feel like a fool if you didn't do it yourself. But just months after Bogle's birth, the U.S. stock market collapses. Bogle's father, William Yates Bogle, loses his job, and all of his inheritance money. He tries to recoup, but lacks the tangible skills and resourcefulness to survive. He never recovers, and becomes addicted to alcohol. [Music] With his father buried in alcoholism, Bogle and his two brothers are forced to grow up quickly, and start working early. You know I think his father was not a great achiever, he didn't achieve a lot, and um, had trouble holding down a job and I think that also probably sparked Bogle to want to make something of himself. From a young age, Bogle develops a strong work ethic, and a meticulous habit of saving every penny he earns. This is a defining period of time for John Bogle. His harsh childhood taught him to be frugal and self-reliant. These qualities will become the guiding principles for his business in later life. The young Bogel knows, there's only one way to a better life. He needs to get himself into a great college. To do that, he has to become the hardest-working student in his high school. By 1947, his hard work pays off. He graduates from Blair Academy as a class salutatorian, and earns a full scholarship to one of the nation's best universities, Princeton. [Music] John Bogle has become accustomed to using brute force to get ahead. He aims to become the top student at Princeton, and he plans to accomplish that by working harder than anyone. But he quickly realizes that Princeton is not the same as his high school. Bogle finds out that Princeton was full of students that not only just worked as hard, but also seemed to perform better in classes. For the first two years, Bogle's grades consistently failed to measure up, often with him ending the semester with C's and C minuses. By his junior year in college, Bogle realizes his only way to graduate from Princeton as a winner, is through writing an exceptional thesis. At a time when, December of 1949, and when one was thinking about one's senior thesis, and I was going to graduate in 1951, you can't start too early at all. Since I was a contrarian, I wanted to write a thesis on a subject that nobody had ever written on before. Bogle bets his academic success on a thesis. But the problem is, he has no idea what to write about. [Music] [Music] To make his thesis stand out, he must write something unique. As an economics major, Bogle soon becomes fixated on a new type of investment company - the mutual fund. I opened Fortune Magazine. The industry was described as tiny, but contentious, and no one's ever written on this before that I knew of, there may have been some later but I have never seen it, and I picked on the spot, in the library, that topic for my thesis, the open-ended investment company of the mutual fund. In 1951, the mutual fund industry is still in its infancy, managing barely $2 billion dollars in assets. It's an insignificant portion of the finance industry. So a mutual fund is not just one company, it typically consists of two companies, one serving as the management company, and the other is the actual fund, in the form of a partnership. So if you invest in a mutual fund you, are legally joining a limited partnership, and that partnership will hire the management company to manage your money, and the management company will invest your money in different financial assets, like stocks and bonds. But for most Americans who barely came out of the Great Depression alive, just a decade prior, the safest investment is still savings in a bank. But Bogel realizes that the mutual fund industry is on the precipice of a revolution. Bogle believes that in the long run, more American investors will see the value of having access to a diversified portfolio, one that the mutual fund industry provides. Bogle's thesis is a success. His analysis and insights on the mutual fund industry sets him apart. He graduates from Princeton, Magna Cum Laude. His outstanding thesis paper also has an unexpected consequence - it also catches the attention of a prominent mutual fund. [Music] Walter Morgan is the founder and chairman of the Wellington fund - the 5th largest mutual fund in the country, worth over a $150 million dollars in 1951. 35 years earlier, Walter Morgan was a stock trader. After losing virtually everything from betting on oil stocks, Morgan became convinced that it was impossible to make money from speculation. He turned himself into a defensive stock investor, and created a so-called balanced portfolio. Less-volatile funds tend to work well for investors, and so, of course, if you, instead of, going, having just stocks ,if you combine it with bonds say in a 60%/40% mix, the classic mix, it's less volatile and it's easier on investors, it's just less drama, and that works well for investors. He then founded his company to help others do the same, by avoiding the temptation of speculation, and focusing on steady growth, and preservation of capital above everything else. By the early 1950's, his fund, Wellington, becomes a pillar in the mutual fund industry. After reading Bogle's college thesis, Morgan immediately recognizes the talent and the potential of John Bogle, and hires him to be his executive assistant. [Music] Well the most valuable lesson I suppose, was taught to me by Walter Morgan, my great mentor at Wellington. It was all about balance, balance, balance. You know, they'd been through a tumultuous period in the 30's, and even halfway through the 40's, and it worked just fine, a balanced idea. He also drummed into me the fact that the crowd was always wrong. Uh, if if everybody wanted something, that's what you did not want. But Bogle's timing to join Wellington couldn't be worse. By 1958, the bull market is in full swing, with Dow Jones almost doubling from 5 years prior. Many mutual fund companies are opening more funds to attract more investors. As a result, Wellington's balanced portfolio is falling out of favor, as the risk-appetite of Americans has come back. But John Bogle sees this challenge as an opportunity to make a name for himself in the company. He devises a bold plan, one that his mentor might not approve of. Bogle wanted to start a new fund that contained only equities. He believed that a stock-only fund will attract investors as long as they stick to a conservative investment strategy. The Wellington Equity Fund is an instant success. In just one year, it grows from $33 million dollars, to having $44 million dollars of assets under management. The fund's performance and popularity continue to grow for the coming decade. The success of the Wellington Equity Fund makes Bogle the designated successor to Walter Morgan, and by the time Morgan turns 67, he officially passes the reins to Jack Bogle, and at the age of 35, Bogle becomes the CEO of one of the largest mutual funds in the industry. But it's a mutual fund whose entire existence is now under threat. A war in the mutual fund industry is about to break out, only this time, Bogle may be its' first casualty. [Music] By the early 1960's, the spirit of speculation is back, in what's become the Go-Go decade. Bogle may be the leader of Wellington, but as the competition heats up, the mutual fund starts to decline. During the bull market when everyone was doing so well, all of a sudden, his Wellington Fund started to look very boring and mediocre, and people didn't just want steady growth anymore. They wanted to make a fortune in the market. As more investors jumped ship from Wellington, Bogle begins to worry. He knows, if he doesn't do something fast, his company may go under. Given the responsibility at age 35 to take over the Wellington Management Company, because we were in deep deep trouble, and Mr. Morgan said do whatever it takes to fix it. To save the company, Bogle needs to somehow make his Wellington Fund attractive to investors again, and there's only one path forward - Wellington needs to merge with another fund. [Music] To save his company from becoming obsolete, Bogle tries to find a merger with a more established firm, like Franklin Templeton, and Incorporated Investors. They reject Bogle's offer because they believe Wellington's overly conservative strategy will hinder their fund's performance. [Music] Unable to find a large mutual fund to merge with, Bogle is forced to search for smaller ones, and soon a fund in Boston catches his attention. iVest is an aggressive mutual fund that has the best performance in the industry from 1960 to 1965. Even with just $17 million dollars under management, it's one of the most sought after funds in the industry. iVest was very akin to today's prop trading firms, using a lot of short-term strategies and technical analysis. So during the bull market, it's very hard to judge if the success of such a firm is due to luck or skill. But Bogle believes, by merging with iVest, Wellington will be able to expand the business and attract more investors. After months of consolidation, a new company is born. While it will carry the name as Wellington Management Company, the partners of iVest will now have 40% ownership. Many consider giving iVest so much control a huge risk factor, but Bogle believes it's a sign of sincerity. Finally, Wellington is reborn, ready to take on its competitors and regain its market share. John Bogle is poised to continue leading a new company as CEO. But fate has a different plan. [Music] Weeks before the board of the new company announces Bogle to serve as the CEO, he suffers a massive heart attack. For a while, Bogle has lived under a heart condition called heart arrhythmia. He's suffered multiple minor heart attacks since the age of 31. But none of them was as severe as this one. Bogle is hospitalized for six weeks. As a result, his future as the chief executive of Wellington is now on the line. Unsure if Bogle is fit to lead, the directors of Wellington are considering a new candidate. Only Bogle isn't one who gives up easily. So to prove he was fit enough to work, Bogle went on the treadmill test. So a typical patient with his heart condition wouldn't last for more than eight minutes But Bogle, with his unbelievable willpower, lasted for more than 18 minutes. After demonstrating his health, Bogle is successfully elected as the CEO. [Music] For the next five years, the marriage between iVest and Wellington looks like one made in heaven. iVest continued to gain popularity, as it consistently beats its' competitors. Leveraging iVest's popularity, Wellington opens more funds. By 1973, Wellington has 10 mutual funds under management, worth over $2.6 billion dollars. While Bogle has little regard for his own net worth, he relishes the power and influence as the head of Wellington, which by now is the third largest mutual fund in the industry. But what he failed to realize is that, it has all been an illusion. After a decade of a speculative growth, the Go-Go era is coming to an end.  Does that sound familiar? Consider today, since 2008, we've seen record bull markets, cash printing, and sky high valuations. The result? Now, the Federal Reserve is brutally stamping out inflation, at the expense of your portfolio. Last year, out of the millions of people who invested with Vanguard 401K, a record number had no choice but to pull their money out. Now, more than half of Americans who made six figures are living paycheck-to- paycheck. At least Goldman Sachs is clear about where the market is headed. Nowhere. The financial titans of today say the 60%/40% portfolio of stocks and bonds is dead. Instead, they're pouring hundreds of millions into assets with low correlation to the stock market. One even appreciated over a 130% the last time inflation soared this high - contemporary art - helping grow and preserve billions in personal wealth. Of course, it's been impossible to access, without deep pockets, that is, until now. Masterworks is a New York-based billion dollar startup that is changing the way people invest in art. As someone who has invested in shares of a Basquiat painting through Masterworks, I'm grateful to be part of this journey, along with so many others. In 2022, Masterworks had 9 exits, all of which were highly profitable. The last three returned 10%, 13%, and 35%, netting millions and millions to investors. It's exciting to see how quickly new offerings sell out, but I have a special link in the description that gives you priority access so that you don't have to wait in line. The stock market plunged yesterday and stepped up trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its biggest loss for a day in almost three years. The index tumbled 18.29 points to finish the session at 909.69. In a span of a year, Wellington's assets is down from $3 billion to $1.3 billion dollars. Now, it's all too clear. Bogle's decision to merge with iVest has been an utter failure. And then there's more bad news. As the industry conditions worsen, a rift between the board of directors widens. A fight soon breaks out, pitting Bogle against four Boston partners of iVest. Afraid Bogle may blame them for the fund's failure, the fort partners decide to throw the first punch, secretly negotiating and gathering support from the board of directors and Wellington to fire Bogle. Remember during the merger, the four partners were given 40% control of the company, because Bogle thought they were reasonable people, And Bogle only had about 28% of the voting power for himself. The board summons Bogle to inform him, he needs to resign immediately. And, these guys had a real falling out. I think Bogle felt like he had betrayed his uh, mentor, and the company by, sort of selling out and giving these other, um, hot shot growth managers too much power in their partnership, they had effective voting control, so they got into a fight, fingers were pointed, and basically they fired Bogle. But to their surprise, Bogle refuses to resign, and threatens to do a proxy fight. Afraid that Bogle may win a proxy fight, the board decides to find a compromise. Instead of keeping Bogle as the CEO of the management company, Bogle now can keep a job as the president of the fund company. The job is a powerless position. It's an arrangement cooked up by the directors to silence Bogle's influence on the company. Since a mutual fund is typically managed by an external management company, the president of the fund typically doesn't do anything, much like the vice president of the United States. By 1974, Bogle is defeated and humiliated, kicked out from the company that was rightfully his. But even in a powerless position as the president of the fund, Bogle refuses to accept failure, and immediately begins to look for ways for a comeback. What he does next, will turn the mutual fund industry upside down. The 1970's is a decade of economic turbulence. The Vietnam War and the high government spending from a decade prior finally catch on, with inflation running the highest it's ever been. John Bogle set out to build his Wellington Management Company the leader of the industry. But his decision to merge with iVest has proven to be a mistake. He's ousted as the CEO of Wellington Management, and is installed as the president of the fund. A traditionally useless position designed to bury his influence. But Bogle is determined to find a way around the stranglehold of the management company. To do that, he will need to make a bold move. [Music] So legally, as the president of the Wellington fund, Bogle is forbidden to make investment decisions. But since the fund is a partnership, Bogle is able to make business and administrative decisions. He basically, fought back, and he found this sort of, little leverage, which was that he was still the president of the mutual funds themselves, and so there's this wonky detail that the mutual funds are like shell companies, and the president of those funds actually has some control over who, you know, like, general contractors, they can decide who is doing what role. And so he used that leverage to basically dig in and fight with them. While a mutual fund typically outsources the administrative works to the management company, Bogle makes a game-changing decision. He will no longer give the management company that business' function anymore. Bogle internalizes the administrative functions, saving the fund millions of dollars in fees. What Bogle did was breaking the industry norm. A typical mutual fund doesn't do sales administration on its own. It typically pays an external management company to handle the tasks. To once again show his independence, he changes the name of the fund from Wellington to Vanguard. For the first time, Bogle believes his fund will be shareholder-focused. He calls it, a mutualization. It all lies in, I think, mutualization, trying to run mutual funds for their shareholders, and not for their managers. For the coming years, Vanguard, with its' new structure, saves investors millions of dollars in fees, making Vanguard the most cost-friendly fund to invest in. [Music] John Bogle has managed to turn his humiliating failure into a success, but he's convinced a bigger opportunity awaits. He needs to completely cut Wellington Management out of the picture. The problem is, as a fund, Vanguard is legally forbidden to manage its own investment. It must hire an external management company, like Wellington. Bogle is convinced there's a way around this. After witnessing so many mutual funds underperforming the market for the long term, he started to question the value of such an effort. He questioned if it's even possible to beat the market. Bogle realizes in the long run, it is nearly impossible to outperform the market, and to serve his shareholders better, all he needs to do is to invest in every stock, while keeping the cost low. It's a type of fund that was impossible to execute. Today, we know it, as an index fund. So, it's not that it's impossible to, uh, outperform, but what I've often said, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack, and at least the core of your portfolio ought to be invested in broad-based indices. Influenced by Malkiel's research, Bogel believes the best path forward is to start an index fund - one that doesn't need to be managed. The simplicity of an index fund is brilliant, and Wall Street is never the same. [Music] Bogle launches the first index investment trust in 1976, designed to maximize shareholders' long-term profit. But what he doesn't know, is whether people will buy it. But despite Bogle's good ideas, his Vanguard index fund struggles to take off. The press is calling it, Bogle's Folly. Anyone who invests in an index fund is doomed to have a mediocre result. The main criticism at that time was that by putting money in every company, in everything, it was very anti-capitalism. Bogle believes the only way to prove that his fund is better, is by patiently waiting, until the fund accumulates a good track record for the coming years. [Music] Just seven years after the launch of the world's first index fund, American investors finally began to recognize the performance and the reliability of an index fund. And Vanguard's first index investment trust takes off, accumulating $100 million dollars in assets by 1982. And I remember in 1993 after looking at the underperformance of all these fund managers, finally, kind of coming over to Bogle's attitude about the whole thing. Of course, it wasn't just, uh, that you could get into them, uh, and buy into the S&P 500, it was cheaper. Remember, you were paying 2%, 2.5% per year for active management at the time. Most of them were not outperforming. Suddenly, you could buy in for a fraction of that, into the S&P 500. It was a simple insight yet, really revolutionary. By 1988, Jack Bogle has accomplished the impossible, building the world's first index fund, worth over $1 billion dollars. His Vanguard Group, with its many low-cost funds, is the second largest mutual fund company in the industry. But for Bogle, it isn't enough. He wants to be number one. Occupying the top spot of the mutual fund industry is Fidelity, led by an aggressive and elusive man, Ned Johnson. And he isn't about to let Vanguard eat his lunch. By the early 1990's, Fidelity is the uncontested king of mutual funds. It was founded by Ed Johnson in 1930. Fidelity was one of the first mutual funds to deploy a diversified investment strategy. On top of that, Ed Johnson was a pioneer in hiring salespeople to sell mutual funds, as if it's a product on the shelf. By the 1980's, it's the biggest mutual fund in the industry, with enough funds covering all sectors and asset classes. But out of all the funds, the only one that is capable of outperforming the market, is the Magellan fund. [Music] And it's all because of one man - Peter Lynch. From 1974 to 1990, under his management, the Magellan fund achieves a mind-boggling 29% annual return for more than a decade. The legendary performance made Fidelity the most popular investment company in the industry. With its' growing control of the industry, who can possibly take on Fidelity now? Only one man would dare. [Music] Bogle's low-cost and better performing index fund has disrupted the mutual fund industry, and is also slowly eating away at Fidelity's market share. Fidelity believes the only way to beat Vanguard is by delivering performance better than index funds. [Music] To outperform Vanguard, Fidelity begins to expand to more areas, including starting an international bond fund. Ned Johnson demands the traders to do what it takes, to beat the market, and deliver above average returns. Jack Bogle knows this is a recipe for disaster, all he has to do now is to wait for the giant to stumble. Bogle realized that given long enough time, most of the active management funds will underperform. He called it, reverting to the mean. Even today, if you look at Berkshire Hathaway for the past 10 years, they didn't do any better than the market. And before long, Bogle's prediction comes true. The fallout of higher United States interest rates affected Mexico, hurting many emerging market bond funds.  Fidelity was hit harder than most. After making a bet on Mexican debt, Fidelity's newly foreign bond fund suffers a severe trading loss. As Fidelity crumbles, their failure demonstrates the validity and safety of Vanguard index funds. [Music] By 1995, Vanguard, with its' low-cost index funds, has turned the entire finance industry upside down. Many of its' competitors are rushing to catch on. With Vanguard in a better shape than ever before, Bogle decides the time has come for him to retire. For the past years, he's been grooming his executive assistant, Jack Brennan, to succeed him. In May, 1995, Bogle officially passes the CEO title to Brennan, but he remains the chairman of the company. Brennan grew up in a banking family. His father was the CEO of Union Warren Savings Bank in Boston. As the head of the Vanguard group Brennan aims to leave his own mark, and to prove to his father that he can outdo him. [Music] Brennan decides the only way forward is for Vanguard's assets to grow bigger. That means increasing spending on marketing and sales. There is just one problem. Bogle may never agree to this. This industry became a total marketing business, it became an opportunistic business, it became a business creating, uh, expectations on past performance that could never possibly be duplicated in the future. As far as Brennan is concerned, to pursue his plan without repercussion, there's just one solution. Bogle must resign as the chairman. Jack Bogle has helped put Brennan in the CEO position, but now his protege has turned on him. John C Bogel was tough enough to survive a heart transplant. But now he cannot overcome the policies of the Vanguard group, the mutual fund company he founded a quarter century ago. At the age of 70, the chairman should retire by tradition, but Bogle wanted to make an exception for himself, because after all, he's the founder of the company. But Brennan and the board did not approve it, and they forced Bogle into retirement. In a span of 20 years, Bogle has built an unimaginable empire. [Music] While the company he founded will live on, and dominate the finance industry for decades to come, for Bogle, he is forced into retirement. With Bogle gone, Brennan expands the marketing and sales. But to truly leave a legacy, he needs to find something even bigger. By the late 1990's, a new segment of the finance industry is soaring - the ETF's. [Music] As the world enters the new millennium, Wall Street is undergoing a revolution. A new type of investment fund is growing at a unprecedented rate. They're called exchange traded funds. It's a concept that has long been difficult to actualize, but now, all of the major Wall Street firms are staking their claims. ETF stands for exchange traded fund. A fund that trades on the exchange. So think of it as a mutual fund that is available to be purchased in the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Market. ETF's may be the trend, but one man believes that they are too volatile to benefit the average investor. If I have a little bias against the ETF, market went down 300 points in the middle of the day, you got out, and it went up 300 points at the second half of the day. I mean a lot of bouncing around, it's meaningless. But in the long run, in the long run, that's a nuance, a different, no difference whatsoever. With the retirement of Bogle from Vanguard, and to compete with Fidelity, Jack Brennan is considering getting into the ETF's business. [Music]  Vanguard went very big into ETF's, it turned out to be a fantastic move. Uh, Vanguard itself quickly surpassed, uh, Fidelity, its' big rival, because Fidelity was slower getting into the ETF business, and as a result of Vanguard's decision to sort of go against Jack's wishes, Vanguard is now a giant. By 2019, Vanguard has almost $5 trillion dollars in total assets. Many criticized that by being one of the biggest ETFs, Vanguard hurts his brand for being a long-term driven fund, by contributing to the short-term speculations of the market. Although Bogle founded Vanguard, he remains critical of Vanguard during the later stage of his life. Well it's difficult, let me be honest about it, it's difficult, the company, is not particularly smitten with my, uh, directness and outspokenness in my books, and when someone says, well I understand you disagree with Vanguard, in that point, I said, absolutely not, I would never disagree with Vanguard. Vanguard disagrees with me, and it's their right  On a crisp winter morning in 2019, the world mourns the loss of a legend. Jack Bogle is dead, succumbing to esophageal cancer. Some more breaking news, this time, sad news. An icon of the financial industry, John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard group, dead, at the age of 89. Jack Bogle lived with honor and integrity. He defended his ideals until the last day. From a poor child struggling to survive during the Great Depression, Jack Bogle didn't stumble upon success. He fought for it. As a result, millions of American investors are better off. Jack Bogel has probably done more for the American investor, than any man in the country. Jack, there he is.

    "content": "An ambitious young businessman, Warren Buffett,\nis in the early stage of building his financial empire. He's set his sight on a struggling\ncompany out of midwest, hoping to break it apart and sell its assets. Sanborn Maps provides minute-by-minute maps\nof power lines, water mains, and city traffics to insurance companies. Before the event of GPS, accurate real-time\nmaps are very difficult to make and they're very valuable for insurance companies. They\nhelp insurance companies analyze risk factors to come up with better insurance policies. But as the industry gets consolidated, Sanborn's\ncustomers base declines, sending its stock price well below its book value. To Buffett, this is an opportunity to make\nmoney almost at no risk. He discovers that the company owns a portfolio of assets that,\nif liquidated, would generate 65 dollars per share. But there's just one problem - to convince\nthe company to liquidate that portfolio, he will have to gain a board seat. To do that,\nhe will need more capital and Buffett knows precisely where to raise money! [Music] Because Buffett thought this investment was\na sure thing, he got his entire family on board - his aunt, his mother, his father...\nHe tried to raise money from everyone he knew. Buffett has one purpose - to have enough money\nto gain a board seat in the company. Six months later, he's successfully elected as a board\nmember of Sanborn. Buffett immediately calls for a board meeting\nproposing to other members his plan to liquidate a portfolio to unlock value. But to his surprise, they reject Buffett's\nplan. Buffett discovered that none of these board\nmembers own enough stock. They were just a bunch of freeloaders, using company resources\nfor themselves. Warren Buffett has no interest in standing\ndown. He is going to intimidate the board members into submission. [Music] Buffett was taught by his mentor Ben Graham\nto avoid concentrating too much money on one investment. But Buffett goes against that advice and immediately\nbuys more shares of Sanborn. With enough control of the company, Buffett returns to the board\nmeeting. He informs the board if they don't follow his plan, he will fire them all. Afraid for their own benefits, the board members\ncave in, agreeing to split the company and the young investor from Omaha walks away with\n45% profit on his investment. He will go on to dominate the investment industry\nfor the next 60 years. He will leave such a mark on finance. He's nicknamed - The Oracle\nof Omaha! [Applause] Warren Buffett is born into an affluent family.\nHis grandfather owns a successful grocery store. His father makes a comfortable living\nas a stockbroker. But when Buffett turns 2, all of that prosperity\ncomes to an end when the country crashes into the Great Depression. It's hard for us to imagine the suffering\nand the immediacy and the fear and the sense of being out of control, the loss of control\nover one's life that the Great Depression brought on to so many families. Losing all of his fortunes during the crash,\nhis father Howard Buffett struggles to recoup. But he quickly figures out a way to turn the\ncatastrophe into an opportunity. He realizes that since people have lost their\nfortunes in speculative stocks, he will instead start selling safe stocks, ones that will\nhelp his clients protect their capital. Howard Buffett quickly earns reputation as\na prudent stockbroker who can help his clients protect their assets. His honest and principled\nway of doing business leaves a huge mark on young Warren Buffett. The best gift I was ever given was to have\na father that I had when I was born. So in all ways he was teaching me. Never taught\nby telling me things. He just taught by example. He had unlimited confidence in me, even when\nI screwed up, I mean and that takes you a long long way. To Warren Buffett his father is his hero.\nWarren idolizes Howard Buffett mostly because he can never get any love from his mother. Well I think we were terrified of her! When\nI'd wake up in the morning, I'd listen to hear her voice. I could tell by her voice,\nit was gonna be a terrible day or not. Warren Buffett's mother has a family history\nof mental disorders, many of whom were admitted to insane asylums. My mother would have terrific headaches and\nyou didn't want to be around her when she was having the headaches and she would she\nwould lash out more. She would never do it in public. Even when Warren was a young boy Leila Buffett\noften verbally abuses Warren Buffett and his sister. If you have a parent who's constantly making\nbackhanded comments at you, constantly criticizing you, constantly comparing you with other kids\nand shaming you and you know that's kind of hard for a child to hear, especially from\nyour parents who are supposed to be your protector, supposed to be your your primary caretakers.\nThat's definitely going to interfere with your beliefs about your world and yourself. His mother's constant verbal assault makes\nyoung Warren scared and withdrawn from socializing with other people. He develops the habit of\ncollecting stamps and bottle caps. Buffett as young boy really enjoyed sorting\nand counting things. I think it because it gave him a sense of order and predictability. But as Buffett enters his teenage years, his\nchildhood problems send him down a dark path. In the nation, the only permanent way to prosperity\nis a balanced budget. You have heard Congressman Howard LH Buffett, Republican member of the\nHouse of Representatives from Nebraska. Howard Buffett is elected as a congressman\nand he moves his family to live in Washington DC. The young Warren Buffett certainly finds himself\nin an unfamiliar environment, unable to adjust to the life in the country's capital. With Howard being consumed by the duty of\na congressman and as his mother continues to terrorize him and his sister, the teenage\nWarren Buffett becomes rebellious. Te started skipping schools and hanging out\nwith the wrong crowds. He stole stuff like golf balls and was involved in practical pranks\nand scams. Warren Buffett's rebellious behavior continues\nuntil finally Howard Buffett decides to intervene. He' tellsl his son - you can do better than\nthis! Knowing that his father, the man who means more to him than anyone else in the\nworld, is disappointed, Warren Buffett is devastated. H e vows to change his ways and\nto never let his father down again! [Music]\nOn a trip to New York with his father, Warren Buffett is introduced to Sidney Weinberg,\nthe senior partner of Goldman Sachs. The meeting left a huge impression on the\nyoung Warren Buffett. He saw Weinberg as the kind of archetype that he wanted to become. The young man is determined to become rich\nand he will do that by starting his own businesses. He made a lot of money from delivering newspapers\nand he also owned a pinball machine and he was able to convince the local barber shop\nto put his machine in. Buffett excels at calculating odds. He realizes\nhe can leverage the skill by getting into horse betting. By the time Buffett graduates\nhigh school, he's earned five thousand dollars through his many ventures, the equivalent\nof fifty thousand dollars today! [Music] While initially planning to skip College,\nBuffett is persuaded by his father to continue his higher education. Since he graduated top\nof the class, Buffett is accepted to Wharton School of Business. While most students attend Wharton to become\nfuture executives for companies like GE, Warren Buffett has only one purpose - to become a\nbetter investor. He's delighted to learn that a co-author of\nhis favorite book is teaching at Wharton. The book is called Security Analysis and the\nauthor is David Dodd. A year went by, and and I got very good grades\nin college. I may not... my grades improved as I as I went along in school and but I I\ndidn't feel I was learning that much there. But his attitude changes when David Dodd introduces\nBuffett to his co-author, a man who will change Buffett's life forever!\n[Music] Benjamin Graham is a professor at Columbia\npioneering an investment technique that comes to be known as \"Value Investing.\" After witnessing the calamity caused by irrational\nspeculation during the Roaring Twenties, Graham re-thought a better investment strategy, one\nthat could make profits without taking on much risk. And everybody on Wall Street is so smart that\ntheir brilliance offsets each other! [Music] And whatever they know is already reflected\nin the level of stock prices pretty much and consequently what happens in the future represents\nwhat they don't know. Buffett has been admirer of Graham long before\nthey meet and Graham immediately sees the potential in Warren Buffett. There are half a dozen that had a tremendous\ninfluence and certainly Ben Graham uh influenced me enormously in terms of giving my me the\ninvestment framework to work, to go for it. I wouldn't be remotely where I am without\nwithout Ben Graham. After graduating college Buffett enrolls in\nColumbia University's MBA program and also begins working for the investment firm that\nGraham owns. Buffett is hired as a stock analyst. His job\nis to search for companies that are called \"Cigar Butts.\" Cigar Butt approach to investing which is\nwhere you try and find a kind of pathetic company but it sells so cheap that you think\nthere's one good free puff left in it. And and uh we used to pick up a lot of soggy\ncigar butts you know? By working at Graham-Newman, Buffett hones\ninvestment skills but more importantly, his job allows him to search for investment ideas\nto grow his own money, which by now stands at $19k or about $200k in today's money. And\nhe soon finds the perfect opportunity! [Music] Rockwood is a chocolate maker in Brooklyn,\nNew York. But due to a sudden spike in the price of cocoa beans, the company struggles\nto remain profitable. But Graham and Buffett discover that the company has a large storage\nof cocoa beans that can be sold to make a profit. There's a problem though. If the company sells the cocoa beans at the\nmarket price, they will have to pay a large tax bill, which will eat away a lot of the\nprofit. The opportunity is too good to miss! Still\nunsure of how to solve the tax problem, Ben Graham finds a deal partner who comes up with\nan ingenious solution. JayPritzker is an investor with a savvy knowledge\non tax laws. At the age of 32 , just 7 years older than Buffett, Pritzker is looking to\nbuild his own business empire. To avoid paying taxes, he realizes he could\noffer the cocoa beans to the shareholders of Rockwood, in exchange for their stocks.\nJay Pritzker purchases enough shares for himself to build up a controlling interest. And he\noffers to exchange the cocoa beans at a premium of two dollars more than the market value.\nBen Graham immediately knows this is the perfect arbitrage opportunity. He could buy the stock of Rockwood at $34\na share and then immediately exchange to $36 a share's worth of cocoa beans. He then would\nuse the futures contract to hedge against any price fluctuations of cocoa beans, which\nguarantee about two dollars per share of profit at no risk! Ben Graham may have found a way to make a\nquick buck, but his student Warren Buffett is planning something even bigger! [Music] Buffett realizes that if Jay Pritzker is willing\nto overpay two dollars in order to buy more stocks from Rockwell's shareholders, he must\nbe convinced that it's a great company to own! Contrary to Graham's strategy, Buffett puts\ndown 75 percent of his own savings in the company's shares, betting everything on a\nrebound of the company's stock! [Music] If Pritzker is wrong, Buffett risks losing\nnot just money but his reputation at his company, especially from his mentor Ben Graham. From the ruins of the Great Depression and\nthe savagery of the second World War, American economy is bouncing back even stronger. As\nthe country enters the 1950s, fortunes are being made everywhere, and the finance industry\nreaps the reward. Buffett is an ambitious young investor from\nthe Midwest. He's determined to become a millionaire by 30. While working for the legendary investor Ben\nGraham, Buffett thinks he has found an opportunity to make his first killing. Putting down the\nmajority of savings in just one stock, Buffett is betting everything on the chocolate manufacturer! Rockwood's stock eventually shoots up from\n$36 to $85 a share, and the young investor nets over $13,000 of pure profit, the equivalent\nof $144k in 2022. Warren Buffett is a follower of Ben Graham\nbut not an imitator.He understands the essence of value investing so well that sometimes\nhe goes against his mentor's ideas. Impressed by his protege's performance, Graham\nquickly advances him through the ranks. Buffett is content with his wealth and status,\nand he expects to be made partner at Graham-Newman's company in no time. But everything is about to change! Just when Buffett is ready to be made partner,\nBen Graham decides to retire and dissolve his partnership. Ben Graham lost interest in investing because\nhe thought he had enough for the rest of his life. On top of that, he wanted to spend more\ntime on other interests, like women and fine arts. To Buffett, this event is a reminder of how\nmuch he hates not being in control of his own career. With his credential, he could\neasily land a lucrative job on Wall Street, but Buffett decides to do the unthinkable. At the age of 26, Buffett leaves New York\nand goes back to his hometown Omaha to start his own shop. Months after I came back, some members of\nthe family said what should we do with our money and I said well I'm not going back in\nthe business of selling stocks but if you would like to join me in a partnership, I\nsaid I'll be glad to do it. So within a couple of months after coming back, I set up the\nfirst partnership. With the help of Graham, Buffett is introduced\nto many wealthy investors who entrust their money to his new investment partnerships. With enough funding for his new company, all\nhe needs to do now is find a big idea. [Music] Buffett knows to make above average Returns\non Investment, he needs an edge, one that other investors don't have. At that period of time, Buffett loved the\npink sheets which contain companies traded away from the stock exchange, often at a very\nlow price. To be fair, a lot of those companies are scams. But Warren Buffett believes there are potential\ngold needles in this haystack and after a diligent search, one company catches his attention. National American is an insurance company\nlocated in Nebraska. Like many insurance companies, it started off as a fraud, but after years\nof legal maneuvering and with changes of management, it has turned itself into a legitimate company.\n[Music] Many of the stockholders are farmers and they\nare unaware of the company's changes, thinking their shares are still worthless. But Buffett estimates the stock for the company\nis worth at least $100 a share. The problem is where to find those farmers. So Warren Buffett and his crew go visit those\nfarmers in person and to buy the stock off their hands, sometimes at a 70% discount from\nthe original value and a lot of those farmers are just happy that their stocks are finally\nworth something. By going places his counterparts aren't willing\nto go, Buffett's BET on National American generates him handsome profits, and he applies\nthe same approach of bargain hunting to many more obscure companies, generating 100% annual\nreturn for the first five years! By 1962, Buffett partnership grows to have\n7.2 million dollars in assets, bigger than what Graham-Newman could ever be. At the age of 32, Warren Buffett is on the\nfast track to becoming a financial titan but what he doesn't know, is that his next investment\nwill be the biggest challenge in his career! Buffett's early success is largely due to\nhis ability to find obscure information that others don't have, such as the pink sheets. In 2022 we have an explosion of information,\nso overwhelming that many of today's investors are unable to find any real value anymore. But there's one company that is solving that\nproblem.

[Music] Applying the same investment strategy, Buffett\nsearches for his next cigar butt's companies, ones only he can unlock the value. And soon,\na forgotten windmill company catches his attention. Dempster Mill manufacturing is a family-run\ncompany that makes windmills and water irrigation systems in Beatrice Nebraska, a small town\nof fewer than 10,000 people. Buffett discovers that the company has an\nabundance of physical assets while the business performs poorly. The company was traded at $18 a share at a\nbook value of $72. It's virtually unheard of, nowadays. So Buffett kept on buying and\nwaiting for the stock price to go up or he could liquidate the company to make a profit. Buffett purchases enough shares to have a\ncontrolling position at a company but he fails to realize just how incompetent the company's\nmanagement team is. The managers of Dempster Mill did not understand\nbusiness cycles. They kept buying more parts and making more windmills when there was no\ndemand in the market. It caused the company to accumulate a lot\nof short-term debt. Unable to pay off their debt, banks are ready\nto seize Dempster's inventories and shut down the company. [Music] To Warren Buffett, it's the worst\nnews. Buffett has put 1/5 of his partnership's capital\ninto this company. If the company goes bankrupt, he may lose all of it and his dream of building\na financial empire will be ruined. Desperate to salvage his investment in the\ncompany, Buffett will need help from someone who has the resources and the toughness to\nget things done and he knows just the man! Charlie Munger [Music] [Music] Munger is a prominent lawyer in California\nand a budding investor who dreams of achieving financial success. He bought a windmill company! A little town\nin Nebraska. And Warren didn't know anything about running a windmill company! He bought\nit because it was cheap. He said what do you do? Why can't you fix my windmill company?\nWho can you get to help me? I said I've got just a man for you. After assessing the situation, Munger realizes\nthe windmill company is broken. To turn it around, Munger brings on a colleague of his\nto replace the chief executive of the Dempster Mill. So one of my old colleagues from a transformer\nbusiness who was an accountant. I said he will fix your windmill company and Warren\nwas desperate he he didn't. He just hired him on the spot. They fired hundreds of workers, sold off equipment\nand closed five branches, not only to have enough money to pay the bank obligations,\nbut also to survive as a business! After the bloodshed, the company is viable again. Buffett\nthinks he has solved the dilemma and he may finally get out of the mess by selling a company\nto another buyer. But he has no idea what is about to happen! [Music] Buffett may have saved the company from bankruptcy,\nbut in return he has disrupted the lives of thousands of working-class people in the small\ntown of Beatrice. Many take to the street to protest. The news\nthat Buffett is selling the business to another corporate raider causes massive outrage. In the eyes of the folks at Beatrice, Buffett\nis nothing but a ruthless liquidator who only cares about making a quick buck for himself. Together, the people of Beatrice start a fundraising\ncampaign and put out three million dollars of their own money and buy Dempster Mill back\nfrom Warren Buffett. The company is once again back in the hands\nof the local people. What Buffett did to Dempster Mill is known\ntoday as activist investing, but at the time it had a different name - Corporate Raiding.\nWhat bothered Buffett a lot was that he never had any ill intentions and people should be\nthankful that he saved the company! Even in defeat, Warren Buffett nets two million\ndollars profit from this investment. To his investors, Warren Buffett seems like a maverick.\nBut to Buffett, he needs to find a way to repair his reputation. His next investment\nwill present an opportunity to do just that! The 1960s is a turbulent decade for the country.\nFor millions of young Americans, they feel pessimistic about the future. But an aspiring\nyoung investor out of Midwest is just as optimistic as ever! Warren Buffett has gained prominence\nby buying failing companies and turning them around for profitability or ruthlessly liquidating\ntheir assets. But his latest investment with a windmill company has made him rethink his\napproach. After facing protests with his involvement with Dempster Mill, Buffett now must prioritize\nhis reputation along with profit. It's a difficult balance in the finance world, but he soon\nsees an opportunity to prove that it can be done. American Express is on the rise to become\na financial conglomerate, while the main business is a credit cards, American Express also has\na more secretive division that is raking in huge profit! it's a business of issuing warehouse receipts.\nSo if you're an owner of a large amount of commodity like oil or cocoa beans, you can\npay American Express to inspect your warehouse and issue receipts. And then you can use them\nas collateral to borrow more money for the banks. But one American Express customer realizes\nthat this process could be easily rigged for his benefit. He's an owner of soybean oils,\nbut he fills a large part of the tanks with seawater and installs a device to trick the\ninspector to think there are all soybean oils. His scheme allows him to deceive American\nExpress inspectors to issue him more oil receipts, which he uses to borrow a large amount of\nmoney from banks. He spends hundreds of millions of loans to\ngamble in the financial market and suffers a huge loss, until his scheme is exposed. Nnable to collect money from him, the banks\nturn to American Express, trying to claim hundreds of millions of dollars of losses. [Music] Its share price is cut in half as\ninvestors run scared. The future of the company now hangs in the balance. Former partners of Anthony D'Angelis, the\nkey figure in the multi-million dollar food oil swindle were given federal prison sentences\ntoday. They were charged with conspiring with D'Angelis to defraud American Express warehousing\nof 50 million dollars with fraudulent receipts. While American Express suffers one of the\nworst crises in its history, Warren Buffett sees an opportunity to invest and a chance\nto remake his reputation. Buffett saw American Express as a very well-run\ncompany and the market over exaggerated this little setback. He purchases one million dollars worth of\nshares, expecting the company to rebound in the future. But banks who lost money from the scam are\ndemanding American Express to pay up! Legally, American Express could take it to\ncourt and argue that they don't have to pay because they are just as much a victim as\nthe banks. The president of the company Howard Clark\nplans to pay banks $60 million as a settlement, but many shareholders of American Express\nthink it's too expensive and the company should fight it out in the court! Warren Buffett is not forced to make a stand.\nHe decides to support Howard Clark's plan to pay $60 million to the banks that lost\nmoney. He believes that while it comes at a huge\nshort-term cost to the company, by paying a settlement, American Express strengthens\nits brand for the long term as a trustworthy company that can be accounted on. Buffett goes on to win the argument, and American\nExpress stock bounces back, making Buffett $3.5 million dollars in profit! Buffett's partnership keeps growing as he\nkeeps finding bargain companies to invest. [Music] By 1965, his fund has $37 million dollars\nunder management. While Buffett's investing approach has made his investors and himself\na fortune, it still has flaws. And his friend Charlie Munger knows it! Well, it was perfectly obvious and he made\nso much money in the other technique that it was hard for him to leave something that\nhad worked so well. But it was not going to scale. Buffett has made his investment success by\ngoing against the crowd. He isn't about to change his ways. And now his stubborn persistence\nis about to get him in trouble yet again, as he begins to Target another struggling\ncompany - Berkshire Hathaway! [Music] To Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway looks\nlike another quick cash grab - a badly rung company but full of valuable assets that can\nbe liquidated for profit. I bought the first shares of Berkshire in\n1962 and it was a northern textile business destined to become extinct eventually and\nit was a statistically cheap stock and a terrible business. Berkshire Hathaway was closing mills and as\nthey closed the mills it would free up some capital and then they would repurchase shares. So I bought some stock but the idea that there\nwould be another tender offer at some point. And we would sell the stock at a modest profit! Buffett buys enough shears that are about\nto make him the majority owner. The current boss of the company Seabury Stanton takes\nBuffett's actions as a hostile takeover threat and he invites Buffett for a meeting. During\nthe meeting Seabury offered to buy back buff his shares at a premium and they agreed on\na price. But Seabury quickly goes back on his words\nand it turns out the meeting was just a setup to gauge Buffett's intentions. Warren Buffett is furious! If he weren't going\nto take over the company before, he's certainly going to now! [Music] His emotion gets the better of him as Buffett\nis about to start a war to take over a company that's worth essentially nothing! [Music] Buffett keeps buying shares of Berkshire\nHathaway, determined to own the company and to get revenge on Seabury Stanton. Buffett\nwins the fight, and Berkshire Hathaway is now under his control! [Music] But it quickly turns into a hollow victory.\nThe company is broken. One of the reasons Warren's successful is he's brutal in appraising\nhis own past. He wants to identify misthinkings and avoid them in the future. But it was an\naccident that he chose Berkshire Hathaway, if the chairman hadn't tried to cheat him\nout of an eighth, there wouldn't have been any Buffett - Berkshire Hathaway history. Buffett may have defeated his enemy, but in\nreturn, he now owns a declining textile company. But he's finally ready to learn his lesson\nand to turn this failure into an opportunity for growth. He is determined to build Berkshire\nHathaway into an Empire that is unlike anyone has ever imagined. But he also knows he can't\ngo at it alone! While Buffett has been taking on failing companies\nto make incredible profits, Charlie Munger has been quietly building his own investment\nfund. But the two future Titans of American Finance\nrealize they share the same purpose, and it's time to join forces! [Applause]"

    "content": "Through cut-throat competition and self-interest,\none firm has managed to survive for more than a century and in the process become the symbol\nof Wall Street. Much admire, much hated, and the best Risk\nManager on Wall Street. it's clearly a culture that cultivates ruthlessness. Remember for Goldman to be winners, there\nhad to be losers. [Music] [Music] in 1886 after making a small fortune from\nhis clothing business, the Jewish immigrant Marcus Goldman decided to get into Finance. He sees a need for small businesses to turn\ntheir accounts receivables into cash quickly. At the time, bank loans are harder to get\nfor these small businesses. He would offer to buy their short-term debt\nat a discount and resell them later to other investors and bankers at a higher price. These short-term loans later became what's\ncalled commercial papers. Around that time, it was the beginning of\nthe investment banking industry. Unlike commercial banks that provide more\nguaranteed and safe financing, firms like Goldman Sachs provide riskier financing - hence\nthe term Investment Banks. Ten years later Marcus Goldman grows his business\nto selling around 30 million dollars in commercial papers per year. At the age of 60, Goldman has already surpassed\nthe average life expectancy and to make sure the family business thrives after he retires\nhe brings on his son-in-law Samuel Sachs as a partner. By 1896 Sachs grows the firm to have 1.6 million\ndollars in capital, shared among five partners for the business of issuing and trading commercial\npapers is quickly becoming saturated. To grow, they need to find the next big thing\n- by the late 19th century, it is taking companies public AKA IPOs. If it's the first time you've been issued\nshares it's called an IPO or initial public offering. So you're a private company. It's just you and a few friends own the company\nbut now you want to go public, you would generally go to an investment bank, talk to them about\nhow to do it and the Investment Bank would solve that problem for you by doing an underwriting. At the time doing IPOs belonged to more elite\nfirms with a European heritage. As a Jewish firm, Goldman Sachs was sort of\nthe outsider. But the Goldman Sachs partnership is determined\nto break into the IPO underwriting business and they know just where to look. [Music] They're going to start by taking a\nJewish company public. [Music] In 1897 Sears had a net worth of 250 thousand\ndollars, but by 1905 it made 37 million dollars in revenue and 2.8 million dollars in net\nincome. It's a perfect candidate for an IPO. But taking Sears public will be a tremendous\nundertaking, more than what Goldman Sachs can handle alone. Goldman Sachs decides to partner up with another\nup-and-coming Jewish firm - the Lehman Brothers. Together, they underwrite 30 million dollars\nof Common Stocks and 10 million dollars of preferred stocks for Sears. Both firms rake in an unprecedented amount\nof fees from this deal. As a result of their success, many companies\nbecome their clients and by 1914 Goldman Sachs becomes a prominent Investment Bank on Wall\nStreet! The senior partner Henry Goldman even gets\ninvited to become a designer for the U.S Federal Reserve System. But IPOs are a cyclical business. After profiting millions in fees for issuing\nstocks and bonds, Goldman Sachs now needs to find a way to reinvest its money. The timing is flawless! The Roaring 20s is one of the greatest bull\nmarkets in the history of America. It was a boom like we've never had. There was a belief that we were in the Emerald\nCity! Think about the Roaring 20s it was the Go-Go,\neverybody was optimistic, markets were soaring, when it's so easy for anybody to go get out\nalone and then go speculate. As an opportunist, Goldman Sachs intends to\nfully capitalize on it. It forms a trading Corporation by putting\ndown one million dollars in capital, but immediately sells more shares to the public at 10 times\nthe price. As a result, the trading Corporation raises\n93 million dollars and their original investment is worth almost 10 million dollars. Today the entity is more or less like the\nSAPCS - special purpose acquisition corporations. As you can see, the essence of Finance hasn't\nreally changed. After making money virtually from thin air,\nGoldman Sachs Stars more investment trusts simply because there are people in the market\nwilling to pay for them. This is not unlike the.com bubble during the\nearly 2000s or the cryptocurrency mania recently. During the Roaring 20s, you can just create\nan investment trust out of thin air, take it public and the market will buy it. Day by day we were nearer to the final triumph\nover poverty than ever before in the history of any land. But nothing good lasts forever. Eventually, everything comes crashing down. That day it's October 29, 1929. Half of the active manpower of the United\nStates drifting helplessly in search of work. Marriage is off 22 percent, divorce rate down\nsharply, suicide rate 40 percent higher. The crash is the worst America has seen in\nits short history and Goldman Sachs trading Corporation is reduced almost to nothing. Hundreds of millions of dollars are evaporated,\nand the partnership of Goldman Sachs lost 13 million dollars of its investment. Within a year, hundreds of investment trusts\ngo bust, taking down investors and investment banks with them [Music] Goldman Sachs manages to survive the crash\nand its clients surprisingly stayed with the firm, all thanks to one man - Sidney Weinberg. Sydney Weinberg is raised in a poor Brooklyn\nhousehold. He's the third of 11 children. To support the family, he's forced to quit\nhigh school early, but even as a young man Sidney shows a willingness to work hard and\nthe ability to network. Started as a janitor at Goldman Sachs, he\nhustles his way to the very top of the company in a period of 15 years. He had a tremendous capacity for connectivity\nwith other people it was impossible to not like being with Sydney Weinberg. With his ability to make friends in high places\nWeinberg single-handedly brings about the majority of the investment banking business\nto Goldman Sachs, including taking General Electric public. Even after the collapse of Goldman Sachs Trading\nGroup Sydney's clients still decide to stay with the firm. The successful comeback of Goldman Sachs makes\nSddney Weinberg hungrier than ever. He now attempts to do something impossible\nhe's going to take four Motors public [Music] Fort Motors is a giant car manufacturing company\nstarted by revolutionary entrepreneur Henry Ford. Ford always thought in the sense of consumerism\n- how one could sell a vehicle at its cheapest. You know sometimes populist in politics talked\nabout \"a chicken in every pot .\" Henry Ford wanted a car in every driveway. By 1956, Ford is the second-largest cart maker\nin America. Its IPO will make any Investment Bank a fortune. Henry Ford, he never trusted Wall Street. He thought Wall Street was gambling and that\nit was to rip off the folks. Even JB Morgan Jr has failed to take Ford\npublic at one point. Henry Ford was a great man but not a good\nman and you know was really devoured anti-semite, so we can never mistake greatness in business\nfor being a great person. But it has been nine years since Henry Ford\ndied, his grandson Henry Ford II is a vastly different man. To Sidney Weinberg, this is his chance to\ncash in! [Music] A big breakthrough came in the 1950s when\ngolden was allowed to underwrite the IPO of Ford Motor Company, given that Henry Ford\nwas considered anti-semitic. (It's a )sort of a seed change on Wall Street. As profit rolls in, Goldman Sachs needs to\nfind more ways to reinvest them. As it turns out, a small trading department\nat Goldman Sachs has been making a killing. This department is led by a legendary Trader\n[Music] Gustav Levy. America is on the rise! After the Civil War, the country experiences\nrapid growth like never before. One industry reaps the reward of this economic\nprosperity more than any other - Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, a prominent Investment Bank,\ncapitalized on the expansion of American businesses by taking them public and in the process making\nitself rich and powerful. After the IPO of GE and Fort Motors, Goldman\nSachs becomes one of the most profitable investment banks on Wall Street. But to them, it's never enough. They don't think in terms of money. They think in terms of winning. Now, naturally if you win big in business,\nmoney follows. But that shouldn't be your objective. Your objective should be to win - to win! Win all the time! Not sometimes, every time! [Music] While Weinberg brings in a steady stream of\ninvestment banking deals, one Goldman Sachs trader has struck gold with a trading strategy\ncalled \"Block Trading.\" His name is Gus Levy\n[Music] Born in a middle-class household in May 1910\nin New Orleans, Levy dreamed of making the big bucks in New York. Through calculated risk-taking, by the time\nLevy turns 30, he's already a millionaire and a well-respected partner at Goldman Sachs. His specialty is block trading - a form of\narbitrage. Levy learns that because the market can react\nunpredictably when the investor sells a large block of shares, he could negotiate a price\nwith the investor privately, at a discount. He then will resell the shares gradually in\nthe market at a profit. At that time there were many inefficiencies\nin the market that get rise to these arbitrage opportunities. The profit is small but firms like Goldman\nSachs had a high leverage. By the 1960s as Sydney Weinberg is approaching\nhis retirement, Gus Levy becomes his heir apparent and for the first time a traitor\nbecomes the boss at Goldman Sachs. The guy was a shaker, maker, doer. Gus Levy was in there seven o'clock in the\nmorning with two secretaries working with him around the clock. His life was the business. For the coming decade, Gus Levy drastically\ngrows the trading business making it a major source of revenue for the firm. But as Goldman Sachs issues more Securities\nand engages in trading at a larger scale, the firm becomes even more vulnerable. For a lot of finance companies, it doesn't\nmatter how big they get, they're often just one mistake away from a total collapse. Goldman Sachs is back to make that mistake\n[Music] When the Pennsylvania Railroad acquires New\nYork's Central Railroad in 1968, it becomes the country's largest railroad company, called\nPenn Central. While the company already has a 1.2 billion\ndollars in debt, an enormous amount, it still needs more to operate. It hires Goldman Sachs to issue another 100\nmillion dollars of commercial papers. With a high rating and especially seeing Goldman\nSachs as their underwriter, investors pour in, eager to buy Penn Central's commercial\npapers, believing they're a safe investment. The bankruptcy trustees have done their best\nto give good railroad service but Penn Central has not been able to generate revenues sufficient\nto prevent continuing deterioration of its track and equipment, including its Freight\nYard Fleet. After the bankruptcy of Penn Central, the\ninvestors of its commercial papers are nearly wiped out and they immediately start suing\nGoldman Sachs for misrepresentation. The funny thing is that the national credit\noffice, a reading agency gave the debt a high rating, because Goldman Sachs was its underwriter\nand Goldman Sachs pushed the company to issue more debt because of high ratings. In the end Goldman Sachs is ordered to pay\n20 cents on the dollar for the investors of Penn Central's commercial papers [Music] That's interesting isn't it?? It's almost as if Goldman Sachs knew something\nwas going to happen beforehand. But the Penn Central Scandal is just a sign\nof things to come for Goldman Sachs. As the economic conditions worsen in the 1970s,\nmore Securities Goldman Sachs issued are going bad. Goldman Sachs is repeatedly forced to pay\nmillions of dollars in settlements to companies like Getty Oil and University Hill Foundation. But none of this prepares Goldman Sachs for\nthe tragedy that is about to unfold [Music] [Music] For a while Gus Levy seemed Invincible. He's transformed Goldman Sachs from a boutique\nInvestment Banking house to an elite institution that is disciplined and hungry. But in recent years, the stress we have caught\nup to him. He dies from a stroke during a business trip. [Music] It's a shock to everyone at the firm as Gus\nLevy never even left any succession plan but people at Goldman Sachs know there is one\nman who's capable for the job and he may just be the guy to turn Goldman Sachs around - John\nWhitehead [Music] Harvard educated, John Whitehead was also\na Navy Commander during World War II and was a part of the D-Day. He realizes Goldman Sachs cannot continue\nto conduct business the way it has been. The firm needs to operate like the military,\nwhere everyone must follow a code of conduct. I wondered how all these new people that we\nwere hiring - how they could be indoctrinated with the principles of Goldman Sachs, the\nconduct that we expected from our people. So on a Sunday afternoon and with a yellow\npad, I wrote down what turned out to be these principles. Whitehead also started to standardize the\ninvestment banking business at Coleman making sure the employees put their clients' interest\nfirst. We arrive at the at the meeting at 5 PM. It's the Friday before the Memorial Day three-day\nweekend and guess what? We are sitting there waiting! A couple guys left okay? When the guy showed up at 10 o'clock, five\nhours late, he said you know the lesson today is about waiting for people that are more\nimportant than you and he said someday if there'll be a billionaire you need to get\nto, he's going to make you wait in his lobby, okay? You need to be conditioned for that? Whitehead's leadership not only makes Goldman\nSachs more profitable, he also restores the trustworthiness in the minds of their clients. The timing again is impeccable! Whitehead knows to win in the business of\ninvestment banking Goldman Sachs must provide the highest \nquality  of service. [SPONSORSHIP] Driven by easy money and relaxed regulation,\nthe 1980s is a decade of a deal-making. Companies are eager to acquire and merge with\neach other, creating an abundant opportunities for the investment banking industry. After overcoming countless crises, Goldman\nSachs remains a force to be reckoned with. Under the leadership of John Whitehead, in\n1983, Goldman Sachs makes 400 million dollars in profit - a 60 increase from the previous\nyear. But at the height of his power, Whitehead\nretired from Goldman and becomes the Deputy Secretary of State under President Ronald\nReagan and passes the mantle to Steve Friedman and Robert Rubin. Rubin built the options trading business at\nGoldman from scratch into a major profit engine for the firm. Now having Goldman under his control, he's\nconfident the firm has nowhere to go but up. But he has no idea that an unlikely adversary\nis coming after them! In 1987, Goldman Sachs senior partner Robert\nFreeman is under arrest for insider trading. A few years back, Goldman Sachs was the underwriter\nfor KKR's hostile takeover deal, over the Broadcasting Company Storer. As an insider, Friedman indirectly revealed\nto a business friend the best price level to sell a call option to make a profit. Now that's classic insider trading, but you'd\nbe surprised how many incidents like this go unnoticed. But not this time! Robert Friedman's insider trading was noticed\nby one rising politician, who is looking for an opportunity to propel himself to the mayorship. Rudy Giuliani, the U.S attorney of the Southern\nDistrict of New York. But he doesn't just want to prosecute Robert\nFriedman quietly. He wants to create a public spectacle. So he arrested Freeman but he deliberately\ndragged this case as long as he could and periodically leaked information to the media. [Music] Goldman Sachs's reputation has been dragged\nthrough the mud. For an investment bank, that could be catastrophic\nas their clients may shun doing business with them. as a result. But their clients decide to stick around. Goldman Sachs is really great at bouncing\nback from crises because after all, their clients are American Corporations and they\nrealize as long as Goldman Sachs keeps making them money, everything else is secondary. Rubin successfully navigated Goldman Sachs\nout of the Black Monday crash in 1987 and legal troubles during the early 1990s. Like his predecessor, Rubin also goes to Washington\nand becomes a politician. He's the consummate honest broker and Bob\nRubin will be a worthy successor to Lloyd Benson. Bob!? By 1993 Goldman Sachs makes 2.7 billion dollars\nin profit, a large part of it coming from trading. For a decade, the firm lives under the principle\nof putting their clients' interests first, but that is gradually shifting because Goldman\nSachs's trading business is expanding to a bigger scale, composed mostly of their own\nmoney. Around that time Goldman Sachs had about two\nbillion dollars of Partners Capital, but with 98 billion dollars of total assets! So that's a very high leverage, but the problem\nis that a lot of the partners are retiring and they're leaving with their capital. They need a stable base of capital that can't\nbe pulled out at a moment's notice. The solution? Going public! But there is just one problem - by 1997 Goldman\nSachs has two bosses John Corzine and Hank Paulson. It's an arrangement that has worked well for\nthe firm since the 1970s, but as a public company, there can only be one King and Hank\nPaulson knows it! [Music] I was a competitive kid! I had a little bit of what my wife ridicules\nas a gold star mentality. I didn't want to just learn - I wanted to\nlearn, I want to get an A. As a devout Christian, Paulson strictly follows\na code of conduct in life and business. At Goldman Sachs, Hank Paulson was known to\nhave really loyal clients that stick with him through thick and thin. I think it's because they see him as an honest\nbroker. I have never been a career planner. I am ambitious and competitive but whatever\nI'm doing at the time seems enormously important to me. But Hank Paulson doesn't get along with his\npartner Corzine, and eventually the partners of the firm decide to support Paulson as the\nonly senior managing partner at the firm. By 1997, after bringing three billion dollars\nof pre-tax income for the year and as Paulson firmly installed as the leader. The partnership is ready to go public But no one knows - an unexpected crisis is\nabout to ruin their IPO plan! Long-term Capital Management was a hedge fund\nstarted by John Meriwether, a famed Bond Trader at Solomon Brothers, and backed by a group\nof world-renowned economists. [Music] In a moment of tremendous clarity,\nthey realized that two risky positions taken together can effectively eliminate risk itself. The hedge fund had an instant success, making\n40 percent during this first year and many Wall Street firms are competing to become\nits trading partner. The fund operated on perfect mathematical\nmodels, designed by genius economists who studied the history of the financial Market. That's an old Market rule - \"the market will\ntest you and do what you don't expect it to do.\" In 1998, the so-called Black Swan event happened\nsomething that their models didn't account for a sovereign country defaulting on its\ndebt. August 1998, something happened, no one had\nconsidered possible - the biggest country in the world suddenly and without explanation\nrefused to pay all its international debts. In a single day, LTCM (Sorry guys.) loses\n353 million dollars. After learning about LTCM's trouble, Goldman\nSachs immediately starts dumping its own bond positions into the market, accelerating LTCM's\ndownfall. But ultimately the Fed comes in and bails\nout LTCM and saving Goldman Sachs in the process. We expect that they're going to explain to\nthe members of this committee why the Federal Reserve has organized the three and a half\nbillion dollar bailout for billionaires. Why Americans should be worried about the\ngambling practices of the Wall Street Elites? LTCM's failure may have almost caused a financial\ncrisis but for Goldman Sachs, it only matters that Goldman Sachs survives. Now with the LTCM's crisis resolved and at\nthe peak of the.com bubble, Goldman Sachs goes public! [Music] A big debut expected tomorrow for the Goldman\nSachs initial public offering. The IPO is ... Goldman Sachs goes public by\nthe end of 1999, selling 11 percent of its shares, bringing home 3.7 billion dollars. To go public Goldman Sachs had to release\na lot of never-before-seen information about the company. People now realize just how profitable Goldman\nSachs has been. In the five and a half years before 1998,\nGoldman had made a pretax profit of 12.2 billion dollars. Because of the partnership accounting much\nof the 12.2 billion dollars have been paid out to the Goldman Sachs partners. Now as a public company, Goldman Sachs searches\nfor more ways to make money. By the start of 2000, a new business is booming\n- mortgage-backed securities! [Music] And $500 a ticket, they've come to\nhear how to buy their very own piece of the American dream. You had a huge boom in housing that made no\nsense at all. The financing appetites of the financial sector\ndrove what everybody else did. By 2006, mortgage-backed Securities become\none of the most profitable businesses for Wall Street Banks. In a span of two years from 2005, Goldman\nSachs underwrites about 203 billion dollars of mortgage-backed securities. At the peak of his success, Hank Paulson follows\nGoldman Sachs tradition. Good morning welcome to the White House I'm\npleased to announce that I will nominate Henry Paulson to be the Secretary of the Treasury. He has a lifetime of business experience. He has an intimate knowledge of financial\nmarkets, and an ability to explain economic issues in clear terms. Since trading has become the main business\nfor Goldman Sachs, the next CEO will be a trader - Lloyd Blankfein. At that point, Goldman Sachs is almost like\na hedge fund. They have tens of billions of their own money,\nmanaged by their own people. Their clients begin to play a lesser role. During the bull market, the issue is less\nvisible, but no bull market can go on forever, and their principles of putting their clients\nfirst are about to be tested by the biggest Financial storm in recent history. A news story? The mortgage meltdown! This morning in the mortgage meltdown new\nnumbers showing that a record number of Americans are losing their homes. More than 70 mortgage companies have failed\nin the last few months in America and now the biggest of the big companies, the bear\nStearns, that the big banks are caught holding the bag. What was considered to be a profitable business\nturns out to be a financial weapon of massive destruction. Everybody in this secretization food chain\nfrom the very beginning until the end, they didn't care about the quality of the mortgage. They were caring about maximizing their volume,\nand getting a fee out of it. After the fire sale of Bear Stern to JP Morgan\nChase and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the entire Investment Banking sector is on\nthe verge of total ruin. Having a large exposure to supply mortgage\nloans, Goldman Sachs is among the most vulnerable firms on Wall Street. We're faced with the prospect of a global\nmeltdown! Out of options, Goldman Sachs turns to an\nunlikely savior. [Music] Warren Buffett's investment gives\nGoldman Sachs some breathing room. To recoup from trading loss, Goldman Sachs\nnot only unloads the mortgage-related assets but also starts abetting against them, using\na type of financial derivatives, called credit default swaps. The Sachs figured out before other firms that\ntrouble was coming, they began to figure out in December of 2006 and they made a big a\nproprietary bet against the mortgage market. You shouldn't be selling junk. You shouldn't be selling crap. Ya shouldn't be betting against your own customer\nat the same time you're selling to them. From Goldman Sachs perspective, their argument\nis that if a client wants a type of derivative, they will create it for him, but the actions\nof Goldman Sachs trading Department are separate. The 2008 Scandal is just the beginning of\nGoldman Sachs deteriorating reputation. Since that, Goldman Sachs has been caught\nin multiple illegal activities. [Music] Even with all of that, Goldman Sachs emerges\nunscathed and its clients are still with the firm. I think the secret to Goldman Zach's success\nis that it's exceptionally good at spotting money making trend and simply executing it\nbetter than others, and when the bubble burst, they're quick to cut losses and bounce back. Whenever there's a boom, Goldman Sachs is\nalways among the first to ride it. By 2018 America fights itself on the precipice\nof another booming market, driven by retail investors. As companies like Robinhood offer free commission\ntrading, retail investors are flooding the market, driving the growth of consumer finance. Goldman Sachs sees this as a new opportunity\nto cash in. 2020 has seen the rise of the retail investor\nand now Goldman Sachs, the firm known for catering to the rich, is preparing to offer\nwealth management for the masses. Investing can be an important part of creating\nthe life you want. So we'd like to introduce ourselves .... We are Marcus Invest, an automated way to\ninvest from Goldman Sachs. [Music] It is now 2022, and the world has changed. But for Goldman Sachs, it's still the same\nhungry, opportunistic company. They have got the most formidable internal\nculture of commitment and teamwork of any organization in finance in the history of\nthe world. In the game of the survival of the fittest,\nGoldman Sachs has managed to outlast the majority. It's a firm that is highly disciplined and\nefficient for one thing - profit!"

during world war ii the federal reserve made a deal with the white house to land as much money as the government needs in order to win the war but when the chinese intervenes korea u.s government assumes the federal reserve will continue to honor that agreement [Music] the fear of another war causes the american people to load up on supplies it's called a demand shock which typically causes a surge of prices that can look like inflation in 1950 the consumer price index goes up more than 10 percent it's a dire economic situation and the federal reserve is ready to tighten the supply of money but to make sure the korean effort succeeds truman starts applying pressure on the fed to keep the interest rate low before the korean war the federal reserve was more or less a humble subordinate to the treasury department it was supposed to be independent but really it was just a money printing factory to the white house the federal reserve rejects truman's demand and starts allowing the interest rates on the treasury bonds to rise it means the fed will stop lending more money to the government and banks to president truman the actions of the federal reserve are nothing short of treason forces the chairman of the fed mccabe to resign and brings on a new man he can trust william and chesney martin but the day martin takes over the fed he too turns on truman and declares the fed to be independent and should focus on solving inflation while the fight between the truman administration and the federal reserve is historic that marks a shift in power dynamics in

after observing the development of the korean war from the campus of colombia greenspan writes an article on the national industrial conference board titled the economics of air power for weeks greenspan has been religiously reading pentagon's official's congressional testimony which includes the data on a number of aircrafts in a squadron at how many squadrons per week and the rate of combat losses based on these data greenspan forecasts the number of aircrafts the air force must buy in the future not only that he projected the demand and supply for raw materials like aluminum and

level the fed rejects truman and starts reducing the supply of money alan greenspan is an aspiring young economist the unprecedented rebellion of the federal reserve makes greenspan realize that instead of being advisors economists can have real power he's confident he's just as qualified as any of the federal reserve insiders he just need to make a name for himself after publishing groundbreaking research on u.s aircraft production he instantly becomes a popular name in the economist community [Music] before long he attracts the attention of wall street roy and wallace townsend owns an investment advisory company on wall street since his business partner died townsend has been looking for a new company impressed by greenspan's research he invites him to become his new partner the new firm called townsend greenspan opens for business in september 1953. to greenspan the company is a perfect instrument for him to gain fame and fortune without having to climb the corporate ladder after taking over the consulting firm greenspan started researching the steel industry at that time econometrics was not widely adopted but greenspan uses the power of statistical analysis to build models that taking factors like iron ore shipment in order to make predictions about a steel output as more clients are eager to learn from greenspan's insight his firm raising record-breaking consulting fees within a decade greenspan becomes one of the most reputable economists but his success as a consultant has also brought him something more valuable political capital by 1967 his rise to popularity catches the eye of an ambitious politician who's taking a shot at the white house richard nixon [Music] alan greenspan's rights to fame as an economist is helped by his

delete your account if you don't like it by 1967 lyndon johnson's liberal policies have driven government spending sky high the result is an inflation at an extraordinary level through intimidation johnson has done what truman couldn't he successfully bans the federal reserve to as well greenspan was a devout libertarian so he hated johnson's administration so much that when he was offered to work for nixon's campaign he accepted it without hesitation he believed the welfare programs would cause inflation and even worse it would create a generation of entitled citizens that always expect government's handout what kind of a nation we will be what kind of a world we will live in whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes is ours as to determine by our actions and our choices with nixon successfully taking over the throne greenspan had hoped to be offered a job as chief economist but he doesn't get the job and he eventually realizes that nixon is not a true conservative visionary but an opportunistic and a paranoid politician he sits down in the group and within the first 30 seconds utters more four-letter words than i had heard in the music business and i said there's something extraordinarily wrong here that there were two nixons as nixon's economic policy starts failing by 1974 he decides to point greenspan as the chairman of the white house council of economic advisors greenspan doesn't like nixon but working at the highest office in america is just too alluring the timing couldn't be worse on the first day of his job as the chairman of cea president nixon makes a historic public statement i would have preferred to carry through to the finish that because of the watergate matter i shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow vice president ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office [Music] with nixon gone greenspan keeps his position as the chairman of cea but what he really wants is to become the secretary of the treasury so typically before and during the election the president will want to boost government spending which increases the odds of re-election every economist at the white house suggested president ford do just that except greenspan he advises president ford to stand down on government spending because greenspan predicts the economy will keep growing without any change in the budget spending [Music] after his advice costed the election of president ford greenspan's political career has come to an end [Music] he returns to new york and begins working as a wall street consultant again greenspan also realizes there's much more to learn he goes back to school i finished his phd program but the failure was actually a blessing in disguise from the period of 1977 to 1980 the economy was destined to go down regardless of who's in charge at the white house if it was president ford with greenspan as the secretary of treasury it would ruin his reputation and he would not have become the federal reserve chairman later on but greenspan still dreams of being politics and he won't have to wait for long just less than two years after he returned to the private sector a true conservative candidate is about to join the race for the president [Applause] [Music] after advising reagan during his campaign greenspan becomes the director of social security and then the director of the council of foreign relations he believes ronald reagan will eventually appoint him as the secretary of the treasury but by 1987 a better opportunity has come along [Music] paul volcker was appointed by jamie carter during a time when american inflation was at a dangerous 12 percent volcker forcefully raised the interest rates creating a recession during the first three years but eventually the inflation problem is solved but by 1987 volcker's political ideology becomes at odds with the white house [Music] reagan administration is ready to deregulate banks allowing them to set up securities business but the banks will also need permission from the federal reserve as the chairman volcker rejects them because he believes banks may become too big to fail his action puts him on a war path with a regular administration until volcker is forced to retire paul volcker has advised me of his decision not to accept a third term as a member and chairman of the federal reserve board with a vulgar gone alan greenspan becomes one of the most powerful men in america it's a position that he has dreamed of i just wanted to say that i'm deeply grateful to the president for this opportunity to serve my country in one of its most sensitive economic posts as the chairman of the fed he is now given the ability to control the supply of money greenspan may be on top of the world but the financial catastrophe is just around the corner it will be the ultimate test to the new chairman of the fed this has been the worst day ever in the history of the new york stock exchange the dow off more than 500 points barely weeks after greenspan got in charge of the federal reserve the stock market takes a nosedive there was a point in time before lunch that looked like the gates of hell were about to burst open again and we were going you know another 20 25 down he knows his future as the chairman depends on solving this black monday crash over the years of playing the political game greenspan has evolved from being a libertarian economist to a pragmatist in the event of the black-mounted crash greenspan abandons his freight market principles and is about to bail out wall street he starts flooding the market with the liquidity aka lending money to financial companies which in turn increases the number of buy orders in the market restoring balance then greenspan instructs reagan to seek bipartisan measure to cut the government deficit it didn't matter if the two parties actually ended up working together it was a good enough posturing or signaling to the market because during a panic sometimes all the market wants is just some comfort and assurance greenspan's actions seem to work by the end of the week the panic is over with greenspan securely installed as the fed chairman the american economy enters a stage called the great moderation we had a pretty good run from the 1980s into the early 2000s the economy did very well we had rising stock market most of the world became more interested in market economies able to forecast short-term economic conditions with great precision greenspan has become known as the man who knew with that ability greenspan moves the lever of interest rates in both directions but only enough to maintain economic indicators at a modest level that's a very dangerous position to be in chairman greenspan has practically become chairman mao of communist china he rarely faced oppositions because people just believed that he knew everything about the economy it's not quite right to call him dictatorial that was never his demeanor but he ran the show but economics is not a science no theory or knowledge stayed true forever with a growing sense of intellectual superiority greenspan is about to sold the seeds for a financial destruction [Music] greenspan has ushered an age of easy money one wall street tycoon has capitalized on this economic environment rising from obscurity to becoming the ceo of a giant wall street firm he's accomplished all of that with easy access to capital his name is cindy weil and now while envisions something even bigger the merger between his company travelers with the mega bank city corp [Music] there's just one problem it is illegal [Music] lusseniwal isn't about to let it stop his ambition and fortunately sani wild has a friend who has the ability to turn the tide for him alan gringsman when he was young he used to advocate in favor of monopolies because he believed monopoly firms are simply the ones that run more efficiently than the rest it was illegal to acquire travelers greenspan said nothing the federal reserve gave them an exemption for a year and then they got the law passed thanks to the lobbying by powerful wall street bankers congress and bill clinton remove the glass-steagall act [Music] in the short term the banking industry skyrockets many mega banks are becoming even bigger by merging with other financial companies greenspan's power and reputation is also growing stronger he then goes on to defend the use of financial derivatives striking down any attempt to regulate them regulation of derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary he's appointed again by the bush administration after he seemingly navigated the economy out of the dot-com bubble as the country enters a real estate boom but greenspan knows the market is too hot like his usual tactics he plans to tighten the interest rates but only enough to heal the wound while the underlying disease is ignored nearly two decades chairman greenspan has shepherded our economy through its highs and its lows who will retire when his current term runs out at the end of january after 18 years working as the fed chairman greenspan officially retires and passes the mantle to ben bernanke [Music] he leaves behind an economy that is seemingly still prosperous as wall street firms continue to make record-breaking profits it can only go up from here right greenspan has led us through many recessions but he misses the biggest one since the great depression the federal reserve was set up so that financial crisis like this doesn't happen of course greenspan is not the only person who contributed to the housing bubble but on the other hand he was the most powerful man in the american economy and the housing bubble of 2008 completely shattered his reputation and legacy it's like a mystery story to me you know how in the world did i miss it do we economists know anything because if you don't know enough to capture the most extraordinary event economic event in all of our lifetimes what in the world do we really know for better or for worse greenspan changed america forever [Music] you"

    "content": "foreign [Music] Von Braun and he's so sick and tired of the high interest rates which have created a recession rendering him unemployed and desperate as far as he's concerned one man is responsible for his misfortune Paul Adolf volcker the chairman of the almighty American Central Bank the Federal Reserve Von Brown believes the FED is an illegitimate organization controlled by a certain group of people with agenda and he will put an end to it the Federal Reserve is a highly secure place [Music] after reaching the ground floor Jim Von Braun gets into a fight with security guards foreign Von Braun quickly realizes he's outnumbered his then disarmed arrested and sent to jail in the late 1970s inflation sits at a whopping 12 percent if left unchecked it will inevitably go out of control and it could be the end of American capitalism ever since Paul Walker decided to raise the interest rates he knew it would be a tough fight and after almost getting taken hostage he's reminded of just how real that fight is I don't believe it would have been possible without a man of Paul volcker's stature who understood the business of Central Banking from Soup To Nuts who understood the costs of not dealing with inflation from a broken economy with inflation run wild Paul volcker is the man who restored The credibility of the United States setting the stage for decades of new growth is the man who saved America [Music] during the 19th century America becomes an industrial superpower thanks to the work and Ingenuity of entrepreneurs like Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie [Music] but as different parts of the economy become more connected a flaw in a system becomes evident the United States was built on the principle of decentralization where each state was given considerable power and autonomy unlike the rest of the Western countries like Netherlands and the UK at the time America had no Central Bank such a system worked well for America during a time when Banks were relatively isolated and small the failure of One Bank typically had minimal effect on other Banks from different state there was no need for a central bank until 1907. [Music] during the Panic of 1907 Banks started to fail like dominoes will one group of clients start withdrawing money from their Banks other clients of other Banks become suspicious of their Banks as well a panic of 1907 was the straw that broke the camel's back the US is the biggest economy in the world Americans are saying gee other countries with central banks are not having so many Financial crises why are we after barely surviving the crash the U.S government devises a plan to prevent the next financial crisis they realize that in the event that Banks fail like dominoes there should be an agency with virtually unlimited amount of money to land to those Banks this agency should become the bank of Last Resort it turns out the biggest borrower won't be Banks but the U.S government by lending to Banks and to the government the FED controls the amount of money in the system but the Federal Reserve couldn't just praying automatically they want it there's a requirement to have at least 40 percent of U.S dollars backed by gold the so-called gold standard but the Federal Reserve typically helped more than 40 gold which give a room to control the supply of money the gold standard has worked well in many countries for decades but like what happened to America the world itself has become a one giant economy that is increasingly connected as America becomes the world's leader a new system will emerge the 20th century is the American Century after the decline of the Great Britain a new order is in place and a US dollar replaces the British pound as the world's Reserve currency and this new world is a drastically different game requiring a new set of rules at Bretton Woods New Hampshire delegates arrived for the opening of the United Nations monetary and financial conference in 1944 a new Global Currency system is invented from now on only the US dollar will be linked to Gold while the rest of the world's currencies will be linked to the US dollar [Music] the Federal Reserve now has practically become the central bank to the world now there's a very Troublesome conflict of interest with a setup for the U.S fed there's a guideline to stimulate employment so if the FED lowers interest rates to boost employment it may cause inflation which violates the Bret wood agreement to stimulate employment the fact ignores the Bretton Woods agreement and starts applying economy with a lot of liquidity I.E printing money [Music] in the short term nothing negative happens an America enjoys a prosperous decade of the 1950s and it goes on to the early 1960s while the employment is stable and inflation is low they Here and Now declares unconditional war on poverty in America Lyndon Johnson a Democrat president became overly ambitious thinking that a government could do anything so he started a series of social programs called the Great Society which required a lot of government spending but there is no free lunch Johnson's Great Society program and his war in Vietnam since the government's budget Sky High it in turn pushes the prize level in the U.S to an unprecedented level [Music] to bring the prices down Federal Reserve is ready to raise the interest rates by selling more treasury bills thus reducing the amount of money in the system while goods and services in the economies stay relatively unchanged the reduction of overall money in the system means reducing prices it is only reasonable for the FED chairman Bill Martin to do so again this time but the rate hike means it will be more expensive for businesses to borrow money likely creating a short-term recession and president Lyndon Johnson why not let that happen [Music] the Federal Reserve was established to be independent but to ensure that his Great Society program succeeds Linda and Justin starts applying pressure on the FED to not raise interest rates until chairman Martin gives in we've talked for a long time about the independence of the Federal Reserve that's independence within the government not Independence of the government the FED starts printing more money that can be backed by gold effectively breaking the Bretton Woods agreement thank you and finally President Nixon makes it official this action will not win us any friends among the international Money traders but our primary concern is with the American workers I have directed secretary Conley to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other Reserve assets except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interest of the United States removing the gold standards essentially give the FED even more power to control the money not just in America but the world by breaking the promise established by the Bretton Woods agreement the United States loses its credibility now is up to the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Arthur Burns to restore that trust in the dollar [Music] but just like his predecessor Martin Burns also caves in because of the political pressure especially the pressure coming from Nixon political pressures would grow where do they come from came from Congress they came for the administration came to the business Community came to the labor unions and it was just very hard to resist the whole climate of opinion was against them by the end of the 1970s the U.S dollar has lost half of its value with inflation sitting at a whopping 12 percent the question is how long will this go on inflation running out of control the answer probably for years after Arthur Burns President Carter appointed a new chairman G William Miller from the private sector [Music] lurches made it even worse as a businessman turned that chairman he was even more reluctant about raising the interest rates which could create a short-term recession so everyone at the FED got together and threw him out President Carter has very little options left he needs to find a replacement for the FED chairman fast he knows this decision will either make or break the American economy [Music] Paul Adolf volcker is from a well-off political family in New Jersey volker's father is an accomplished Township manager and a young Volker dreams of following his Father's Footsteps into politics his father was famous for his ability to run the government budget efficiently that along with the fact that he was born during the Great Depression really instilled a great capacity provoker to manage money conservatively and live frugally Walker graduates from Princeton with honors because of his excellent thesis on the Federal Reserve policies Walker then gets his master's degree in political economy for Harvard University with the degrees from prestigious schools Paul Walker's career blossoms in a span of two decades he goes from a financial Economist for Chase Manhattan Bank to working in the treasury Department during Nixon's Administration and then it gets promoted to the governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1975. in October 1979 Consumer Price inflation is running at over 12 percent and after the humiliated Exile of fed chairman G William Miller President Carter has his back against the wall he realizes there's a crisis of confidence he needs to find a new chairman who has what it takes to do the hard things even if that may cost him his second term as president and that new chairman is Paul volcker [Music] by 2022 inflation has come back with consumer prices holding a 9.1 percent from the previous year this has left many Americans worried about the future because at this rate the dollars you stuff under your mattress will lose half of their value by 2030. in 1975 the Federal Reserve board started fighting arts program to improve the working environment of the Fed but surprisingly the value of Fighters also turns out to be a great hedge against inflation and this reputation has only grown over the years with Bank of America's Chief investment strategist recently recommending investing in real assets he believes that in eras when bonds and stocks struggle real assets have provided Superior risk-adjusted returns and according to historical data when inflation is over three percent art beats gold real estate and s p 500. as a result real assets like art are quickly becoming essential to a balanced portfolio personally I would love to allocate a portion of income to Alternative assets to generate more Diversified returns but investing in Fine Arts has had a really high bar of Entry only available to millionaire and billionaire investors that's until I found Masterworks the Unicorn investment platform now I can just pull up Masterworks site and invest choosing from my catalog of offerings backed by physical multi-million dollar art with inflation through the roof demand for Masterworks has skyrocketed but anybody who uses my Phineas link gets Priority Access to their platform to skip the wait list and join the half a million other members of Masterworks I highly recommend you check out that link in the description of this video after his appointment Walker becomes the world's most powerful Central Banker with the tools and weapons to deal with inflation head on volcker understands that a big part of inflation has to do with expectations rather than reality important factor over the Long Haul has been changing not wiser monetary policy but but a monetary policy focused on anchoring inflation expectations on the one hand if inflation expectations are very well anchored then policy can relatively easily succeed in keeping inflation at Target and vice versa if policy is committed to keeping inflation near Target then inflation expectations tend to be well anchored so if the market received the signal that inflation will be dealt with it may stop expecting more inflation and companies may become more hesitant about raising prices of their products volcker announces that a Fed will enact a never-before-seen policy to curb the supply of money rather than focusing on raising the interest rates it's a clever play of words because those two things are essentially the same but Walker knows that a fierce sounding new policy will get the Public's attention it will signal that the FED really means business you know you can't deal with that problem by simply saying we're going to let inflation go ahead Walker Knowles solving the inflation will come at a tremendous short-term cost to the economy but what he doesn't know is that it may also cost his own life [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] even after nearly escaping from being taken hostage volker's nightmare has only just begun it was a very tough period And there's a lot of opposition and no doubt about it and somebody got the idea of sending in all these saw it up two by fours home builders sent volcker their protests scrolled on wooden planks within the first two years volker's fat actions have caused a severe drop in in employment it puts Volker at the center of attack by all fronts even a famous economist Milton Freeman predicts that volcker will fail catastrophically and by 1983 Freeman seems to be right as the U.S economy falls into a full-blown recession and President Carter loses his second presidential bit to Ronald Reagan [Music] he really personifies stoicism it's hard to imagine the kind of pressure he was under when everyone was trying to stop him even with pressure coming from everywhere and everyone Paul volcker decides to keep at it raising the interest rates to an incredible height at some point Crossing 20 percent [Music] neither he nor high nor anyone else had any idea of how high the interest rate is going to be he told me I never thought we'd have to go to 20 percent he did that took courage [Music] inflation is reduced by half during volker's first three years as the FED chairman and it keeps on falling into the rest of the decade as the country enters a stage of prosperity like never before Paul Walker has advised me of his decision not to accept a third term as a member and chairman of the Federal Reserve board with inflation Tamed Paul vocal decides not to pursue a third term he could have served as the FED chairman a lot longer and there were speculations about other reasons why he quit Reagan's presidency is an era of consumerism and easy money it is about deregulation Paul volcker on the other hand as a Democrat believes in regulating Financial companies from becoming too big to fail by the mid-1980s The credibility of the United States has been restored the economy is in perfect state to embrace the third Industrial Revolution the age of information but all of that may not have been possible without the intelligence and perseverance of Paul Walker nice that we have leaders who step up and do the right thing now and then take a long-term View we could use more but after the retirement of Paul volcker a completely different kind of man comes into power [Music] [Music]"

    "content": "it is november 25th of 1986 a day before the shareholder meeting of a legendary company kaiser steele it was founded by american tycoon henry kaiser in 1941 who 10 years earlier built one of the most impressive projects of mankind the hoover dam we are here to celebrate the completion of the greatest term in the world after world war ii the steel company has gone on to become a corporate giant but by the early 1970s due to the increase in labor costs and the competition from china kaiser and the entire steel industry declined sharply while the company is in terrible shape the management team spends lavishly on themselves including buying three corporate jets and mansions by 1986 it becomes a target of a hostile takeover bruce hendry a tough corporator aims to gain control over kaiser's steel corporation he plans to dismantle the company and sell them for pieces before it declines even further hendry has gathered a team of shrewd business operators ready to replace six out of 11 board seats at kaiser tomorrow a line will be drawn the kaiser's management team versus the corporate raiders but ultimately the decision lies in the hands of just one particular shareholder ned johnson by 1986 fidelity reigns supreme on wall street containing hundreds of mutual funds with the largest one being the fidelity fund it has 65 billion dollars of assets money entrusted by millions of middle class americans but these americans may not know when they invest their money into fidelity they are giving out their voting power and this voting power now belongs to one man the ceo of fidelity ned johnson it's the type of power that can alter the direction of corporate america for a long time mutual funds pledge that it will always remain neutral in corporate fights and always side with the majority of the rest of the shareholders for most takeover battles it's clear which side is more profitable but for kaiser is not very obvious who to back for the first time nat johnson is compelled to wield that power but until the shareholder meeting happens no one really knows which side is on the incompetent and wasteful management team or the barbarians at the gate [Music] on the day of the shareholder meeting for kaiser fidelity shocks everyone by firing the current management team but it also rejects hendry's plan instead fidelity decide to bring on a ceo of their own practically fidelity screwed them both and took over the company for itself although the battle for kaiser is far from finished fidelity's active involvement in kaiser's board has altered the company's fate forever [Music] [Music] [Applause] in the 19th century railroads were the bloodlines for the american economy it allowed the country to quickly rise up for the ashes of civil war and become an industrial superpower union pacific is the second largest railroad company in america so-called a duopoly now here we are union pacific the strategic middle rock operating around 9 600 miles of road we serve some of the best neighborhoods in the country but by the end of the 19th century railroads have been overbuilt to survive union pacific tries to develop a new competitive edge they plan to build the nation's first refrigerated train cars to transport produce from southern california to the rest of the country but before they could enact their grand plan a disaster strikes [Music] an earthquake in san francisco causes a great destruction to railroad tracks in california and also sends a shockwave to wall street where the stock of union pacific is being traded the stockholders lost millions in a single day but there's a one man who's made a fortune from this incident jesse livermore a week prior as a stock trader livermore have been borrowing shares of union pacific stocks and immediately selling them in a market a scheme called short selling jesse livermore had a hunch that something unexplainable and awful was going to happen to profit from the downfall of union pacific he sells short as many shares as he could borrow hoping to repurchase them at a lower price and pocket the difference when the earthquake happens just a little more nets 255 000 of profit the equivalent of 7.5 million dollars today in just one trade while no one knows how he predicted the collapse jesse livermore goes on to become a stock trading legend his story is later published in a book a decade later called reminiscences of a stock operator this book will inspire a generation of americans to join the stock market boom in the roaring 20s one of these wannabe stock millionaires is a law student at harvard edward crosby johnson benjamin franklin one of the founding members of america has also accumulated a fortune by the time he passes on in 1790 on his deathbed franklin planned to donate his fortune to charitable causes after his gone but he also knows the power of compounding interest he calls upon a group of people businessman and lawyers in boston to invest and grow his money for at least a century before donating them this trust becomes one of the earliest forms of mutual funds and boston becomes the hotbed for the mutual fund industry born in a wealthy family edward crosby johnson enrolls in harvard law school by following his family's tradition [Music] but after reading about jesse livermore at johnson dreams and making a fortune by trading stocks he then enrolls in harvard business school to learn about investing during the roaring twenties but this was the first time that joe on the street saw the stock market going up and decided i'm gonna go get myself a loan to buy stock and by the way i'm going to make a handsome profit doing it day by day we were nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land but just as ed johnson is about to quit his day job and jump into the stock market the great depression has arrived and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of chalice and selfish wrongdoing there were many causes for the great depression but one of the obvious ones were these investment trusts that spun a lot of money from average americans in order to gamble in a stock market like the mutual funds at the time these investment trusts are unregulated they often borrow money in the bond market in order to speculate in stocks they also don't need to report their holdings to the government and their investors many funds even become money laundering shadow banks that are owned by the mobsters but after the great depression all of that is about to change the fdr administration swiftly passes many regulations to prevent wall street from stealing the taxpayers money to speculate it is perhaps the worst time to join wall street but ed johnson decides to become a better investor he needs to find himself a mentor and through his family connection he meets william parker the owner of one of the largest mutual funds at the time called incorporated investors started as an accountant johnson quickly climbs a letter and becomes a chief financial officer but on the side he also starts managing money for wealthy friends and families in boston although ed johnson's job is lucrative he also wants to become his own boss he decides to start searching for a small mutual fund that he can take over the fidelity fund started right after the great depression by two stock brokers in boston with forty four thousand dollars in assets they take advantage of the negative sentiment the investors feel towards mutual they market their fidelity fund as a safe place that doesn't use any leverage or borrowed money to invest and also has a more diversified strategy in just three years it grows its assets to 3.3 million dollars but then the fidelity fund becomes stagnated as the country is being distracted by the world war ii as an open-end fund where investors can buy and redeem their money at moment's notice they struggle to find more buyers of their mutual fund by the 1940s ed johnson enjoys a successful career in finance with multiple sources of income including six figures a year from salaries dividends and the management fees but that is not enough at johnson dreams of owning his own fund he realizes that fidelity is an excellent target for takeover and an opportunity to be his own boss he plans to consolidate his assets and combine them with fidelity but he also has a more sinister plan to grow fidelity at the time ed johnson had a lot of jobs and there was no such a thing as non-compete agreement while johnson is still on the payroll of incorporated investors he starts quietly stealing their business and sending it straight to fidelity the small mutual funds he just took over use the company's resources like brokers and dealers to bring more business to fidelity i deem this reply a full acceptance of the potsdam declaration which specifies the unconditional surrender of japan while world war ii is over at johnson has also won a secret war of his own for years he's been quietly building his own company under his mentor's nose a direct competition to his boss mutual fund the timing is impeccable after the war ended america is about to enter a huge bull market the 1950s for johnson he realizes that in a bull market the best way to get rich as a mutual fund manager is not by performing well but by selling well johnson was among the first to hire third-party professional sales people to distribute the mutual funds to the public that was the beginning of the boiler room culture when salespeople were very persistent aggressive and intimidating but johnson also rebrands the image of mutual funds from speculative gambling machines to a safe haven for the risk-averse american public he does that by emphasizing diversification by the end of the decade of the 1950s fidelity becomes a major force on wall street managing over 400 million dollars and slowly ed johnson's style of mutual funds become the industry standard but that also means he's losing his competitive edge beat his rivals ed johnson must find ways to outperform everyone else ed johnson finds himself a protege jerry thai a chinese man who will soon make fidelity the most competitive mutual fund in the industry [Music] america is rising after world war ii the country experiences a period of growth like no one has ever seen the prosperity once again has come back to wall street a company at the forefront of this growing bull market is fidelity a mutual fund giant run by the boston financier edward johnson through aggressive sales and marketing johnson has brought fidelity from obscurity to prominence but the competition is quickly catching up his biggest competitor is jack dreifus an aggressive trader who has consistently outperformed the industry by investing in growth stocks johnson knows the rules of the game are about to change he needs to come up with a new way to beat his rivals and he finds just the man to do the job he's going to use a new strategy that no mutual funds have tried high frequency trading with technical analysis technical analysis is the analysis of stock prices or maybe other speculative asset prices by looking at charts of the prices and looking for patterns that suggest movements in prices technical analysis is a subtle arc that can augment trading strategies what type did differently from other investors was that he focused on the short-term trading patterns he also traded in higher frequencies often going in and out of position within a day that was before trading was computerized fidelity had to hire a lot of brokers in order to accommodate his trades it works his phone starts creating about 20 profit a year for almost five years started with just 10 million dollars jared thai fidelity capital attracts 100 million dollars within three years and then another 100 million a year later with this success

johnson also started a second fund for son ned johnson growing up as aristocratic child nat johnson is more social than his father and able to communicate with people of all backgrounds and social classes after graduating from harvard he joins fidelity and starts running a growth fund set up by his father although his performance is excellent he is outshined by his father's protege jared thai by early 1970s edward johnson is retiring to the outside world it seems that jerry thai his beloved and overachieving student is the ideal candidate to succeed in but secretly ed johnson has been planning for his son ned to be his successor for years jeretai has devoted his energy and talent to fidelity under the impression that he will one day become the ceo but eventually it becomes obvious to tai the fidelity never belongs to anyone but to the johnson family he resigns from the company and starts his own firm with his exile many fidelity investors also jumped ship as they realized they could make more money by following thai [Music] it causes a significant loss of capital for fidelity but to the newly crowned ceo net johnson a much worse situation is about to unfold [Music] by the start of the 1970s a terrible bear market has arrived and this one is unlike anything in recent american history an inflationary depression and arthur burns chairman of the fit he did not do what a good central banker should do and raise rates to break the inflation and by the time the 70s ended it was a total mess the mutual fund industry collapses by almost a half and fidelity is bleeding money net johnson just became the ceo with a chip on his shoulder he was never the ideal candidate for the job and with the exodus of the star investor jerry thai and the raging bear market ned johnson may lose everything his father has built for him [Music] to save fidelity johnson knows he cannot rely on his own talent as an investor but to play his bets on younger talents in that particular bear market no one was investing in stock mutual funds in order to keep them alive johnson had to get into money market mutual fund business so a money market fund will generally invest in highly liquid cash instruments with very short maturities and they're typically seen as one of the safest forms of investments you can make tell you the 74 market crash fidelity was in the red now what if we hadn't had a huge money market fund that was making us money while we were losing our shirts while many of his competitors have given up on stock mutual funds net johnson believes that is still the future [Music] he just needs to find someone as talented as jerry thai [Music] peter lynch had a tragic childhood when his father died from cancer when he was just 10 years old growing up without a father taught lynch the importance of having financial freedom to get there he knows finance is the number one industry to get into after earning his mba from wharton business school lynch was hired as a research analyst specializing in steel and metals on the side lynch has built a high-performing stock portfolio during the time when everyone was losing money he was making money so eventually everyone at fidelity was going to him for stock tips to net johnson peter lynch is exactly the type of talent needed to revive fidelity's stock mutual funds without hesitation he promotes lynch as the head of their magellan fund i described dan one word dynamic he attracts good people he want to come here it's because of him he's one of the greatest people to work for ever [Music] unlike jerry thai peter lynch couldn't care less about charts and short-term fluctuations of stocks as a student of logic he believes in a simple proposition when you buy a company to grow and if it's a textile company or it's an electronics company a software company you better understand what they do and and if they do well the stock will do well no matter what happens the market but it's more nuanced than that to win like peter lynch one has to find companies that have the potential to do well and that are yet to be discovered by wall street his way of investing requires a lot of leg work but it works over the next decade peter lynch beats the market almost every single year with an average return of almost 30 percent annually since 1977 lynch's magellan fund returned two thousand four hundred seventy percent as compared to a return of little better than five hundred percent in standard and poor's 500 stock index hiring peter lynch has been a stroke of genius nat johnson capitalizes on peter lynch celebrity status by opening up more funds [Music] for johnson fidelity is a product company almost anything an investor wants he will build it for them they got retirement funds tax savings fund technology funds industry specific funds it's almost like they are walmart for mutual funds but then by the start of 1990 peter lynch does the unthinkable [Music] peter lynch former manager of fidelity's boston-based 13 billion magellan fund surprised wall street in may 1990 by retiring at age 46. the retirement of lynch comes as a shock to everyone in finance but it's especially inconvenient for net johnson as lynch has been his biggest cash cow for nearly a decade to make matters worse in a span of three years many fidelity executives are indicted for junk bond related schemes the allegation was very serious but it's particularly bad for a mutual fund when investors can redeem their shares and moments notice so any staying on their reputation will cost them to make less money net johnson is once again back against the wall his company and his reputation are under threat but he eventually realizes that to bring the company out of the scandal one thing must be done peter lynch must come out of retirement [Music] in 1992 to help restore the public's faith and fidelity peter lynch returns to save the day but he will no longer manage magellan fund instead he will only be working two days a week as more or less on a brand ambassador lynch's return quiets fears and fidelity slowly stabilizes as the bull market returns in the early 90s fidelity is again taking full advantage although competitors like vanguard are gaining prominence fidelity still manages to hold us all all thanks to net johnson's leadership unlike his father ned johnson is really an institution builder his father was content for fertility to be a boutique investment firm but ned johnson has transformed fidelity into a global financial powerhouse while fidelity doesn't act like a family business anymore ned johnson and his family are still in total control of the empire to ensure fidelity always stays in the hands of the johnsons he starts grooming his children to take his place out of all of his kids his oldest abigail johnson seemed to be the most unlikely candidate i certainly never knew that i would actually get to the position that i've gotten to now i was always interested in the business it was impossible not to learn about it between my grandfather and my father ebby is a great salesman like her father and an excellent communicator but at the same time she's also very controlling and secretive by 1994 that johnson starts giving his voting shares to his children but to abby it's a sign that her time has come at the time net johnson was very fuzzy about when to retire and who to succeed him i think the power of being a ceo of fidelity is very addictive net justin doesn't want to retire until the very end abby johnson agonizes over the uncertainty until she decides to orchestrate a coupe [Music] in 2001 abby johnson decides to take a shot at the king she secretly gathers the key stockholders of fidelity in an attempt to remove her own father from the ceo position but it was unsuccessful as the board decides to support nat johnson the man who practically built the fidelity empire but her actions also earn the respect of her father as she demonstrates the ruthlessness that is required in the business nat johnson remains in power for another 10 years until finally abigail johnson finally takes over the throne of the trillion dollar empire [Music] in 2022 fidelity is still at the very top of the finance industry with almost 8 trillion dollars of assets with it comes immense power to influence corporate america but what makes fidelity more powerful and potentially dangerous is the fact that it's still a private company owned by just one family back in 2018 when major financial institutions were very hesitant about cryptos fidelity already started a cryptocurrency fund do they care about cryptocurrency no they just want your money the essence of wall street doesn't change with every new generation they always come up with new ways to gather money whether it is through mutual funds or the more modern index funds fidelity is the best at doing that [Music] you"

    "content": "[Music] when peter lynch turns 10 his father dies from cancer it was a real tragedy because at the time lynch's father made a lot of money as accountant that provided a very good lifestyle lynch's mother didn't have to work but now she has to go back to the workforce taken on two jobs at once and in order to support his mother the young peter lynch has to grow up quickly and to start working as well peter lynch is near the top of anyone's list of great investors he consistently tramps the market for over a decade by observing great ideas in the world around him then researching them and then buying them if they could stand the test of time in the 13 years he ran the fidelity magellan fund he racked up annual average returns of 29.2 percent [Music] with his father gone peter lynch's mother is determined to make enough money in order for lynch to stay in a private school she knows that is the best way to guarantee her son's future but to make it easier for her the 11 year old lynch is desperate to find a job of his own he never expected to work at 11 years old he wanted to have a normal childhood but lynch was a very understanding boy seeing how hard his mother worked to provide for him he made out his mind from an early age that he was going to make so much money when he grew up that his mother would never have to work again but the type of jobs for 11 year old is limited he ends up becoming a caddy at a local golf club his first job as a caddy allows lynch to appreciate the hard work and learn social skills but more importantly it is there he meets his mentor that will completely change his life forever [Applause] [Music] to help support her mother peter lynch becomes a hardest working caddy on the golf course there he meets the executive vice president of fidelity george peter lynch stood up from the crowd because of his work ethic but what really left an impression on george sullivan was that one time sullivan misplaced his umbrella and lynch used his own money as little as it was to buy a new umbrella to give it to sullivan and that act of kindness by peter lynch really left an impression on sullivan peter lynch's excellent work on the golf course pays off and with sullivan's recommendation lynch gets accepted to boston college and receives full scholarship from a caddy scholarship fund in college peter lynch finds out that the most helpful subject to learn about stocks is not economics or mathematics but philosophy especially logic i was on the liberal arts side of boston college avoiding all the required math and accounting courses the normal preparations for business instead i studied metaphysics logic philosophy along with history psychology and political science they're called humanities because they're all about people and finance to peter lynch is all about people at boston college lynch scores perfectly in tests but he knows the true way to examine his knowledge as not by passing his exams but by investing in the real world founded in 1945 flying tigers was the first cargo airline in the united states in 1961 it became one of the first carriers in the world to offer aerial pallet shipping service before then aerial commercial shipping was expensive and nearly non-existent for larger goods flying tigers would be considered a growth stocks because it was a new and small company but lynch saw that the whole aerial shipping industry was going to explode and flying tigers was going to be the leader of it with strong conviction peter lynch put majority of savings in flying tigers stock but for the next three years the stock becomes stagnated it never goes beyond the original price of seven dollars lynch bought it at if peter lynch learns anything from his career on the golf course it is that it takes patience to win but lynch has no idea what is about to happen the united states is therefore prepared to take all necessary steps including the use of armed forces to assist any member of the southeast asia collective treaty in defense of freedom the vienna war unexpectedly becomes the best thing that's ever happened to flying tigers initially lynch thought that flying tiger's business would grow as a result of typing into the commercial shipping business but the vietnam war happened so unexpectedly and it sent the stock price to the sky by 1965 peter lynch original one thousand two hundred fifty dollars investment becomes more than six thousand dollars more than enough to pay for his grad school at wharton while pursuing his mba lynch continues to disregard economics and finance classes that are out of touch with the reality he devotes all of his free time researching the next stock to buy and after graduation from wharton he's eager to get into the real world but fate intervenes by the time peter lynch graduates from wharton the vienna war has reached the critical stage it turns from a special military operation to a full-blown invasion the u.s now needs to recruit more soldiers to send to the battlefield peter lynch is one of them but fortunately for lynch he's stationed far from the battleground all the way in south korea and he spends a large part of his time researching his next investment idea it won't be easy as he is far away from any companies in the us but he believes he could replicate his success with flying tigers he just needs to find another small growth company that no one on wall street knows about a 10 bagger a 10 bagger is a stock which you've made 10 times your money i suspect this technical term has been barred from baseball which goes up to a four bagger or a home run in my business a four bagger is nice but a 10 bagger is a whole lot better and with persistent effort peter lynch finds a perfect stock to buy sugar beets and sugar kings are the mink plants used to produce sugar but unlike sugar kings sugar beets can grow better in a cooler environment such as the state of maine the main sugar industries is a refiner of sugar beets in 1965 the company finds a genius solution for increasing production it realizes that since there's a very little overlap between the harvest time of potatoes and sugar beets it will be profitable to convince the potato farmers to grow sugar bees as well lynch understands clearly that this is a 10 bagger situation mostly because no wall street firms have yet taken notice he immediately buys as many shearers as he can by calling his brokers from south korea expecting to have a windfall once he goes back to america farmers in general tend to be very risk averse and the main sugar company couldn't convince the farmers to plant sugar beets in full capacity instead most of them only use less than one quarter of their farms after coming home from korea lynch vows to never make the same mistake in the future he will never buy stock again without research and more importantly on-site investigation if you're working hard you're always checking with competitors you're checking with customers suppliers you're trying to do work to find out is this company still early am i does they have years and years of growth ahead of them then you stay with it know the stock goes down but in the meantime he needs to make a living in 1969 through his connection with george sullivan he becomes a research analyst at fidelity then the largest asset management company in america [Music] by the 1930s the mutual funds are mostly small family operations consisting of firms made up of wealthy people the only way to grow is through performance and word of mouth but one boston businessman edward johnson thinks there's a better way ed johnson was a great salesman so he thought to himself why not treat mutual fund like a product so he was one of the first to hire professional salespeople who barely knew anything about finance to distribute their mutual fund to the public on top of that ed johnson shifts the focus of the mutual funds from speculative gambles to a safe place for people to earn stable returns by using the new concept at the time called diversification by 1962 fedele becomes the biggest mutual fund company in america but with success comes competition so what happened from the 40s to the 60s was that a lot of mutual funds became overly obsessed with raising money rather than focusing on making returns for their investors so a lot of these funds spend so much money on salespeople on brokers rather than on investment research to beat the competition ed johnson starts deploying a diverse set of strategies including a fund focused on technical analysis run by pioneer jerry thai with his unique way of analyzing charts and patterns jerry ty's fund outperforms the competition by wide margin he becomes a star in the mutual fund industry his success takes fidelity to a new height at the time technical analysis was relatively new tai was using mathematics to spot short-term patterns that other people haven't quite caught up yet and that's why it worked for him by the late 1960s the boat market is slowing but with the jerry ty's performance fidelity is thriving as ed johnson gets close to his retirement age jerry ty becomes an apparent successor but surprisingly ed johnson decides that fidelity is always going to be a family business and his son ned johnson becomes a new boss at fidelity after tight left fidelity loses a great number of clients in the investing world clients loyalty always lies where the profit is in this case they follow with jerry tygo's worse yet by 1969 fidelity is found guilty for its involvement in an insider trading scandal when their broker conspired with a client to commit a fraud with profits down and with the loss of clients net johnson struggles to find a solution he understands that to turn fidelity around he needs to find someone just as talented as tai and it turns out the solution has been standing right in front of him this entire time america is at a turning point after the great depression and world war ii it became the most powerful nation on the planet it's a testimony to the efficacy and the resilience of the capitalist economic system but where there's a freight market there's always a cycle of boom and bust by the early 1970s the economic recession has arrived peter lynch had a rough childhood but through hard work and engineering he graduated from the top business school in the u.s and by learning stock picking from hands-on experience lynch excels at fidelity as a research analyst while the stock market collapses peter lynch stock recommendations thrive however after the exit of start trader jerry thai fidelity is struggling to grow it lost one third of his assets in one year alone the new ceo ned johnson aimed to find a brilliant trader just like jerry thai but little does he know the man who will eventually take fidelity to the moon is anything but like jerry thai [Music] the magellan fund was initially set up by ed johnson and george sullivan as a boot camp to train future fund managers for fidelity lynch started in 1969 as a steel and metals analyst lynch was a research analyst but on the side he was building his own little stock portfolio that consistently beat the market so all the employees at fidelity always came to him for stock tips by 1974 it becomes apparent to net johnson peter lynch is the kind of talent he's been searching for he promotes lynch as the new head of the magellan fund which at the time was a closed fund consisting mostly the wealth of johnson family and their executives as the new boss of the magellan fund lynch knows to outperform the market he must do things the rest of the market doesn't do as the bear market reaches on most mutual funds shift away from stock investing but to lynch a bear market only means one thing bargains there were bargains everywhere in those days my portfolio continued to grow pretty soon i became known as the will rogers of equities a man who never saw a stock he didn't like as a savvy poker player lynch believes that with a portfolio full of potential 10 backers the law of probability will inevitably be on his side if i find 10 good stories they're all equally attractive i buy all 10 and i wait to see them unfold it's like watching 10 poker games 10 games of stud poker you watch the cards turn over story three gets better story six slips story seven stays the same but it goes up fifty percent you sell seven by two and his first ten bagger is a very unlikely company [Music] taco bell was founded by a white man called glenn bell who was addicted to the hard shell tacos at his local mexican restaurant belt learned the recipe and opened up his own stand in 1951 before long he made enough money to open a physical restaurant and then two years later a chain of taco bell restaurants start popping up in california on a trip to california i was impressed with the taco bell burrito they had no debt they never had a restaurant close and i started buying at seven and uh was the largest position of magellan in 1978 taco bell may have been a treasure but peter lynch is not the only one who has found it in just less than a year since peter lynch invested in taco bell the company is acquired by pepsico at 50 a share [Music] having an influx of reliable information was key for lynch to gain an edge with the magellan fund we used to wait for the mail to come to see what nike's inventories were like you know i mean i mean you find out we get in our library in the first class mail so all this information so the investing for the average person now is much clearer they know the same thing as i do i want to thank the daily upside for sponsoring this video it's a free business and investing newsletter that over 400 000

becomes one of the youngest money managers on wall street while the rest of the market is down sharply lynch's fund has generated a 20 profit to peter lynch stock picking is like an art form or a sport the way he practices this art form is by immersing himself in the business that he's going to buy my stock picking method which involves elements of art and science plus legwork hasn't changed in 20 years professional investors are missing the point a pile of software isn't worth a damn if you haven't done your basic homework on the companies they're scrambling to buy services like bridge shark bloomberg first call market watch and they ought to be spending more time at the mall and philosophy is called empiricism which prioritizes learning from direct experiences over anything else peter lynch forms his investment thesis by immersing himself in the business rather than by just reading the numbers on paper it's essentially a human driven approach meaning that if lynch likes the product and other people love the product and the management are good people these serve as a better evidence than just figures and papers lynch becomes unstoppable a year later while the market has bounced back to 18 percent lynch's magellan fund has done even better creating a 51 return in 1979. we are americans god bless you and thank you as ronald reagan becomes a president the age of prosperity has returned the bull market propels peter lynch magellan to stardom as it consistently makes mind-boggling profits although lynch doesn't always pick the right stocks he knows if he gets three out of five stocks right in the long run he will do just fine but even with that assurance one stock investment still catches him off guard founded in 1983 jade beltner was an instant success it became a popular specialty food store due to its understanding of the local consumers in boston bildner's is a specialty food store located across the street from my boston office it sells gourmet sandwiches and prepared hot foods bildner's is a cross between a convenience store and a three-star restaurant i had first-hand information that they had the best bread and the best sandwiches in boston the store was perfect for middle class white collars who had a little bit of disposable income and who want something better than just microwave sandwiches for lunch when the company goes public in 1986 lynch is the first in line to buy stocks at 13 a share since he's become addicted to their sandwiches lynch is confident the soon the stores will pop up across america and millions of middle class americans will enjoy their sandwiches as he does [Music] what peter lynch didn't realize was that biltner was successful because it was local it hasn't yet proven itself that they could succeed elsewhere and when biltner opens a new store in manhattan it fails to compete with the infamous new york by the time the company tries to open new locations in atlanta it has already run out of cash i'm sure the company learned from these mistakes but there was no second chance once the money ran out i gradually unloaded my shares that losses ranging from 50 to 95 the lesson here is if the prototype is in texas hold off buying until the company shows can make money in illinois does the idea work in some other place that's the question i forgot to ask builders after learning his lesson lynch continues to hunt for 10 baggers companies whose products he enjoys who have the ability to scale and who somehow also have been neglected by wall street but lynch gradually finds out that as his fund grows bigger and he becomes more famous it gets more difficult to find 10 backers [Music] by 1989 the magellan has become the most popular mutual fund in america with 17 billion dollars under management peter lynch has been beating the market every year making him the most celebrated investor on wall street tonight johnson hiring lynch has been a stroke of genius and to millions of americans fidelity is lynch and lynch is fidelity lynch is no question a ethical hard-working intelligent person and that was exactly the brand image ned johnson want people to associate with fidelity but then at the peak of peter lynch's career he does the unthinkable [Music] in 1991 after 11 years of exceptional performance peter lynch resigns [Music] for years he was driven by the desire to provide for his mother and his family he has pushed himself to work hard like no one else even at the expense of spending time with his children peter lynch knows what it's like to not have his father around peter lynch manager of the nation's largest and most profitable mutual stock fund for 13 years left his job at fidelity's magellan fund in 1990. lynch's decision to retire young was influenced by his father's death at 46 when peter was only 10. at the age of 48 lynch decides that no amount of money can bite back time with his family but there's one more reason why lynch quit fidelity what many people don't know was that magellan was a closed internal fund for the first five years of his history it had less than one billion dollars in 1980 which was considered small even at that time and when the fund is small you have a wider range of companies to pick from and if you look at magellan's historical performance the best years were in the early years by early 1990s as the size of the fund grows and as a celebrity it becomes increasingly difficult to find 10 baggers lynch decides that while magellan is still performing well it is time to retire and cement his legendary status as the most profitable mutual fund manager in history but little does he know that even after retirement a ghost from the past will come back and haunt him [Music] by early 2000s mutual funds and other etfs have become the most powerful forces in corporate finance [Music] as a massive trillion dollar investment company fidelity is often the biggest shareholder in many major corporations in america so they literally have enough votes in their hands to change the fate of many u.s companies what happens now is that whether if you're active as hedge funds or if you're an executive of a company you need to be on good terms with guys like larry fink and the johnson's family [Music] in 2008 the sec charges fidelity for receiving bribery from various companies amount to millions of dollars including vip tickets for super bowl concerts and even for strip clubs and peter lynch is charged with a twenty thousand dollars fine for receiving bribery tickets for broadway shows and for golf tournaments [Music] but that setback doesn't affect peter lynch's reputation as people trust that lynch didn't break the law on purpose in 2022 peter lynch is just as popular as ever they come to find out that lynch's way of investing is just as relevant today even though the success of magellan fund has made lynch a rich man he has made even more money for the johnson family unlike other financial institutions fidelity is still a private company with almost eight trillion dollars of assets under management [Music] and it is still tightly controlled by the johnson family who now is arguably one of the most powerful families in america [Music] thanks again the daily upside for sponsoring this video check the link in description [Music] you"

he paid me three dollars for something that i had paid 50 cents for uh and ps i'd gotten to read first um and and maybe for the first time in my life i really understood supply and demand uh you know and there was an unlimited demand for that product and so i started quote unquote importing playboy from my friends but in spite of his business acumen sam is mediocre at school his siblings are the top students in college consistently getting higher grades than their brother and sam is struggling to measure up samzell is not your typical ivy league educated investor he's a street smart hustler who is very grounded in the real world but at the time his parents especially his father were a little concerned that sam didn't meet their expectations in terms of school to prove to his father that he can succeed elsewhere semzell becomes fixated on finding a business idea and taking a shot at the time a real estate developer is building a 15 unit student apartment samsel immediately realizes that this could be an opportunity for him to make money we didn't know how to manage for rent departments we had no clue what it entailed it just never occurred to me that i couldn't do it so he created a simple brochure and went to pitch the owners his audacity pays off in spite of his lack of experience the landlord decides to hire him to manage the new apartment zell knows something that other real estate managers don't he knows the customers as a student he understands the kind of housing the students like the most zell and his classmate redesigned the entire interior removing outdated furniture and making the apartment more vibrant he had an insight that other professional apartment managers didn't have he knew that the young people did not want environment like home they wanted something more fun and exciting so at the time the scandinavian style was very popular among the younger generation so sam and his classmates remodeled the interior and bought furnitures with clean and modern designs and it's a huge success his apartment becomes highly sought after by the students after finishing two more apartment buildings the same landlord gave them all to sam zell to manage by the time he graduates from college he has already made a consistent income for managing apartments but he knows this kind of money will never make him rich he needs to start buying his own properties and so i went to law school not because i wanted to practice law i went to law school so i had a degree and that if i didn't work out at whatever it is i was doing i would be able to in effect still practice law and make a living semzell also feels an obligation to his parents to get through law school he enrolls in michigan law although he finds a subject boring and uninteresting but deep down he knows to truly make his own decisions he needs to become financially independent to do that he will own income generating properties he has made enough for his job as a property manager it is time to start looking for apartment building to buy he bought a threat unit apartment building for nineteen thousand five hundred dollars with savings and loans from the bank he remodeled the interior in a way that appealed to students that allowed him to double the rent a few months later the rents it collected become enough for a down payment for another apartment building by the second year of law school semzel owns more than three apartment buildings and also has a management contract for eastern michigan university i graduated from law school in 1966 i was 24. i had 250 000 in the bank and i made about 150 000 that year that was an income of about 1.1 million in 2016. i had established a solid foundation for my family but even with that kind of money sam zell still decides to become a lawyer and treats his real estate business as a side hustle his parents escaped nazis so they had this very risk-averse attitude that got passed on to sam zell he thought he could do both having a stable job as a lawyer was an insurance policy just in case his real estate business failed it's a perfect plan except it won't work in the real world as samsao is about to painfully find out [Music] after earning his law degree samsel starts applying for a job in every law firm in chicago [Music] he believes that his impressive resume of real estate deals will easily help him land a position at the best law firm in chicago i included in the resume you know all the business i started and all the things i had done and along with my gpa and everything else and i then had 44 interviews i had 43 rejections you know i i was in the top quarter of my class i knew this didn't make any sense and now and finally i was interviewing with the head of of one of the law firms and the guy looks at me and he says tell me about your deals and i tell you about my deals i want a job he says oh we would never hire you you'd be here you know three months and you'd be leaving and going into the real estate business so we would never hire either with anybody else he was right although he eventually finds a job through his family connections the circumstances force him to rethink his career choice as a created big picture thinker he realizes he's never built to be a lawyer a job that requires him to be detail driven and meticulous he quits in just four days and decides to do real estate full-time but samsel isn't about to risk his own fortune alone he learns that to succeed in a business he needs to scale that also means leveraging other people's money by now he had quite a bit of success by owning properties in college towns so he started researching he found out that universities in smaller cities across america were growing like crazy so that was going to be his focus in 1966 he raises enough capital from 20 wealthy investors including his father until now the property he owns are small-time apartments but with a large sum of money he's ready to go back samsel's first building is a massive 99 unit apartment building next to the university of toledo it's a one million dollar investment and he has calculated that the worst case outcome is an eight percent return but the upside is a potential 19 percent but all i looked at was the fact that i was able to buy one of the few apartment buildings in town so i didn't have any competition he believes that there's an under supply of quality apartments for students after redesigning the interior based on his acute understanding of what young people want he raises the rant the asset immediately starts generating cash flows and it makes a 20 return within a year so that deal was one of the most successful deals that i had ever done simply because there was no competition and therefore where there's no competition you can produce exceptional margins impressed by samzel's ability to profit the same investors double down and write them bigger checks for bigger apartments by 1971 semzel has become a rising star in the local real estate scene at the age of 30 he has already become a millionaire but tazell is just the beginning opportunities are boundless he put up 10 million dollars to buy the broadway plaza in los angeles half the investment business is about raising money so every time senzel had a successful investment he used that as a marketing tool to raise more money to him scales everything scale was how he would become the biggest player in finance but unbeknownst to zell his investment success has an unintended consequence he now has a target on his back [Music] the 1970s is a decade of drastic economic change in spite of the political turmoil and the failing vietnam war america is still the most prosperous economy on earth a revolution is underway in one of the biggest sectors in america is the invention of the real estate investment trust capital from all over the world is flooding into reits creating an unprecedented boom semzel joined the industry after quitting his job as a lawyer writing the real estate boom he has built a portfolio of residential and commercial properties worth hundreds of millions he may be on top of the world but he has no idea that the rs is gunning for him [Music] semzel's brother-in-law roger basks has been his tax turning on many real estate deals roger a harvard trained lawyer with an impeccable reputation was my go-to person on real estate deals with tax implications in the mid-1970s samjoe was working on acquiring a high rise hotel from reno nevada with very complicated taxes he was trained as a lawyer but he didn't want to get bogged down by the details so he hired his brother-in-law to take care of the taxes for him but a few years later writer's law firm becomes a target of an investigation by the rs both sam and rogers are indicted on the charges of tax fraud samzell's real estate empire is now more vulnerable than ever if convicted he'll lose everything he has spent his last 15 years building ultimately semzell is dismissed without being charged but his brother-in-law basks is not so fortunate getting indicted by the rs will forever leave a mark on samzel's record but he vows to overcome it he will build a business so large and so powerful that no one dares to hurt him again to grow his real estate business semzel needs to raise more money for bigger projects but his brush with the rs has made potential investors skeptical and to make matters worse by the mid-1970s the real estate market has become overly saturated making it difficult to find profitable investments zell then does the unthinkable he stops buying any properties cold turkey as he realizes the real estate market may have been oversupplied and overbuilt everyone thought i was nuts after all occupancies were still over 90 absorption was high companies were hiring it was one of many times i would hear people tell me that i just didn't understand i didn't listen i just stepped aside while the music was still playing sam zell has always been an audacious risk taker he's also very practical investor who knows real estate from hands-on experience but what really sets him apart is the ability to have conviction on his own views sometimes against the rest of the world [Music] by the time the real estate market crashes sam sales immediately goes on a buying spree acquiring distressed properties on the verge of default with just one dollar down payment a majority of them between 1974 and 1977 samsel purchases roughly four billion dollars in assets his bold action and his clever financial scheme pay off and investors become eager to join him again by the mid-80s samsel has built a real estate investment powerhouse making hundreds of millions of dollars a year investing in distressed real estate properties has been a stroke of genius but sends out wonders if he can turn around bad properties can he also turn around back companies and there's only one way to find out he is about to join the corporate takeover business [Music] [Applause] the decade of 1980s belongs to the corporate raiders as the cuts interest rates and lowers corporate taxes companies are flooded with easy money the age of excess is here led by coral icon many wall street titans have amassed unparalleled fortune by taking over corporations they raised the stock price by temporarily firing the management cutting costs and with fancy promises after two decades of opportunistic deal-making samzell has become a prominent real estate investor he owns a portfolio of residential and commercial properties that generate him hundreds of millions a year but saint zell has a bigger ambition if he can turn back property assets into profitable ones he believes he can also turn around back companies in distress if we've been as successful in real estate as we have been are we really just good businessmen and if we're a good businessman then why wouldn't the same principles that apply to real estate apply to buying anything else sam has the skill and the capital all he needs now is just an opportunity by 1983 the predator finds his prey [Music] to become a great investor is to become a lifelong student at all my life i've basically focused on reading and digesting information because the well educated up-to-date you are the better you are to be able to assess judgment and assess risk finance is a field that rewards mostly on the quality of your decision making rather than based on the hours of work you put in decision making is a science and also skill that can be taught and learned brilliant.org is a great place to learn probability game theory and systems thinking which are all the basis for becoming a great decision maker what makes brilliant stand out from the conventional lectures is its emphasis on interactivity it makes a learning process fun and more effective sometimes even with a simple understanding of probability and logic you can easily distinguish between nonsense from real facts to start it for free visit brilliant.org phineas the first 200 people will get a 20 off brilliant annual premium subscription after testing his thesis on smaller companies samzel then says his vision on one big conglomerate itil founded in 1969 ital is a leasing company that owns aircrafts rail cars and shipping containers but after his early success the company's management starts draining the company's resources by throwing lavish parties and paying hefty bonuses to themselves the company filed for bankruptcy in 1981 and emerged from chapter 11 and 1983 with his future still clouded with uncertainty after working real estate for so long samsung developed the strum preference for physical assets and itil was a company with a lot of tangible assets after buying five percent of the company samzell asked the board for a seat at the table but as a newcomer on the scene no one takes zeal seriously the board proudly dismisses the offer samsel isn't the one to back down from a fight he immediately buys up to 22 percent of the company and it starts a hostile bit after a year of back and forth with a board and a proxy fight he successfully takes over the company and becomes the chairman and ceo [Music] as an outsider semzel is now welcomed by the board and the shareholders the only way to prove himself is by delivering tangible results his first job as ceo is to cut costs by selling underperformed divisions and reducing redundancies he had a simple plan find the most profitable business the company owns and double down on that after cutting costs and liquidating underperformed assets samsel has accumulated 50 million dollars of capital the amount needed to invest in a main business one that has a competitive edge for ital is the railcar business in a single year 1979 the industry had built over a hundred thousand rail cars the railcar industry had succumbed to easy money for building that bubble burst in 1981 during that same period 65 percent of the existing rail cars in the country were scrapped on the demand side loadings were flat but stable supply was going down at some point those two lines were going to intersect and when they did anybody with rail cars was going to make a lot of money anticipating a price hike sends up concludes this is the perfect opportunity to buy as many road cars as possible at a steep discount it proves to be a slick business move since the company requires abroad cards at a discount it beats the competition at a wide margin and the company's revenue immediately skyrockets what do most big companies do when they have a lot of cash they acquire other companies it's a great way to diversify the business but sam had a different agenda [Music] sam jello has made a killing by cornering the railcar leasing market successfully turning itil around it is however not a growth market samzell is never content with past successes he needs to elevate itel to a higher level to me it's always what's next and i think that's what drives most very successful people it's never about the money i mean that's a way of keeping score it's about achievement and it's about winning a game and it's about upping the ante turning around a bad company versus growing a company often takes a completely different leadership styles but sam knows as long as they stick to the fundamentals and logic he will find a way he acquires a wiring and cable distribution company in 1987 called anexter brothers with a consistent cash flow generated from itil's rail car rental business samsung will invest them back to expand annexed around the world it's a risky move that goes against what zell has learned about only investing in bargains but if the business exceeds it has the potential to become a unicorn enterprise that will continuously print money for the years to come and it's a huge success anexter experiences an explosive growth and it becomes itil's fastest growing division by 1992 generating close to a billion dollars in revenue a year the success of annexure convinces samsel to unload the railcar business in order to free up more capital to acquire better assets by selling 70 000 rail cars to general motors he reaps 2.3 billion dollars [Music] but with all that success samsel once again does the unthinkable by 1992 he steps down from the ceo position at itil [Music] i think the biggest strength that makes sam zell a great player in finance is his understanding of the public market he is exceedingly good at finding investment opportunities and more importantly raising the necessary funds that match them he's a master at getting equities together in a way that benefits everyone but also more profitable for him in the 1990s samzell seized an opportunity to make real estate investment trusts go public was no visibility into markets or assets and there were no metrics brokers held all the cards and they weren't telling the simple genius of public rates is that they turn bricks and mortar into transparent and predictable liquid assets as the biggest real estate investor in the country samzell becomes a board member of n a reit in an effort to make a complete publicly traded real estate asset he raises additional 3 billion in 1997 after acquiring the largest collection of premium office buildings across the country he packages them all in a reit what he doesn't know is whether wall street will buy it [Music] by the time samsel's reit goes public it's the biggest real estate portfolio in the world comprising more than 32 million square feet of commercial offices what made this read on a very attractive investment was at the predictability of cash flows the tenants were majority companies with average lease term of seven years it allowed samsel to offer a 5.7 dividend equity office properties eventually turns into one of the most sought after stocks as u.s is entering a housing boom by 2006 equity office properties becomes a target of a bidding war by many wealthy wall street firms it's a huge complement to samzel's accomplishment it certifies his position as one of the most powerful forces in finance but even titans make mistakes and semzal is about to face the toughest challenge of his career by 2006 tribune is 159 euro media conglomerate that is a majority owner of chicago tribune the la times and various news networks due to the evidence of the internet the news industry is struggling to adjust after several attempts to sell the company to private equity firms the board of tribune turns to an unlikely buyer the grave dancer samzell we looked at the performance of the tribune for the seven years prior to the time we bought it uh during that seven years average revenue declined three percent a year when we underwrote the deal we underwrote it at six percent decline each year going forward the risk reward of the transaction was extraordinary both ways samzell realizes that these media brands hold long-term value with his magical touch this value could be unleashed he proposes a leveraged buyout deal that will take the company private future of this company is currently right out there in front of us and if we keep operating the way we've been operating in the past there is no future samzell's approach is simple cutting costs by removing redundancies and use the savings from them to opportunistically invest in growth opportunities his approach worked before and may continue the work if only the market conditions stayed the same the timing he took over tribune couldn't be worse it was the beginning of 2008. one point samsel dubbed himself the gravedancer for turning a profit on troubled asset his 8.3 billion dollar buyout of tribune ended in bankruptcy for the publisher in december [Music] the 2008 housing crisis has brought the entire newspaper industry to his knees as businesses are struggling they cut their advertising budget first over the years of corporate battles samsel has become accustomed to getting what he wants but this time he's going against a force more powerful than he has ever encountered even after receiving a 650 million dollar rescue loan from jp morgan the company still struggles to stay alive it's a time of great change for the world samsel suddenly finds himself as a member of an old guard the tribune failure is a reminder that the market can make even the smartest of men look like foals i did the tribune company i lost 300 million dollars if it had worked i would have made 5 billion i liked that risk reward ratio would i do it again yes because the risk reward ratio was appropriate the error of samsel may have come to an end yet at the age of 80 he refuses to retire tired from what i mean i haven't worked since the fourth day that i was in that law firm samzell is a no bs goal getter i think he's probably the most representative of the older generation of investors samzell's rise to the top also coincides with the prosperity america has enjoyed since the 70s [Music] sometimes my team argues with me they can't believe we're leaving money on the table but i want to create an environment where everyone wants to keep playing as an opportunistic capitalist samsel indeed plays the game of market better than anyone [Music] [Music] you"

    "content": "[Music] in the world of finance one breed of investors has endured the test of time [Music] through discipline and rationality they make profits when others lose they find values in places no one dares to look and yet none of them has the same investment strategy all are unique [Music] one of the most different is how remarks the 150 billion dollar vulture [Music] howard marx is raised in a jewish family in regal park queens a prosperous middle class neighborhood at the time his father is a successful accountant money is rarely an issue for the family but underneath the peaceful family life their struggles howard mark's mother has suffered from multiple near-fatal illnesses forcing her to stay at home and leaving her unable to work just when all hope is lost his mother turns to christian science trying to overcome her illness with strong beliefs in christ although raised as jewish howard mark's mother is about to give up her religion and fully embrace christianity as far as she's concerned her unlikely recovery is a proof that jesus christ healed her but the young howard was not as passionate as his mother in fact he starts questioning religion or more specifically how can a person believe in something with absolute certainty i think this tendency to question document or be skeptical about the status quo is one of his strong traits which will ultimately make him a great investor but as a kid howard marx shows no signs of superior intellect when i i was a kid growing up in queens new york i didn't know school was important i didn't work hard my mother came back from every parent-teacher conference and said your your teachers all say you're an underachiever and i didn't know what that meant or why that was a problem but for the first time the young howard start to dream big he wants to take a shot at getting into wharton howard mark learned that as every student in his high school his chance of getting into wharton was extremely low but it didn't cost him much to try and the potential reward was huge somehow or other i decided i want to go to wharton i went to the guidance counselor she said you'll never get it and but i happened to be taking accounting the accounting teacher was the manager of the tennis team he let maybe the he put me uh uh kept me i carried the balls around he liked me and he and he wrote a letter and somehow or other i got into ward and that changed my life he practically made a asymmetric bet and it worked out to his favor and i figured i would study accounting there and become an accountant my dad was an accountant but when i started taking my courses i found finance more interesting more creative than accounting accounting is primarily a form of record keeping finance was more interesting so i switched my major to finance driven by the desire to understand different worldviews howard marx also decides to study japanese philosophy as a minor so i took this course in a japanese philosophy we came across mujo mujo literally means the turning of the wheel of the law in other words the operation of life the essence is impermanence and because the wheel does turn and also the unpredictability of the future and these were really formative for me and they have unconsciously informed everything i've done one of the remarkable things that happened was that howard marx was essentially training his mind to become a great investor although finance and zen philosophy didn't seem to have much in common the eastern philosophy has given the young howard clarity of mind he graduates from wharton in 1967 and becomes an mba student at boot school of business at university of chicago at age 23 howard marx earns his degree for the prestigious business school and is flooded with job offers he sees a clear future lion head of him a career on wall street [Music] after graduating from the very best business school in america the 26 year old howard marx instantly lands a lucrative job at citi bank as an equity research analyst the timing is impeccable just two years earlier the legendary banker walter b riston became the chairman and ceo of the bank in the coming years he would turn citibank into an absolute financial powerhouse walt spent nearly four decades at the service of citibank during which he had a major impact on the development of both the u.s and international banking system among the key innovations citibank introduced under his leadership were the first certificate of deposit credit cards and automated teller machines in the early 1970s banks started to take more risks by issuing more equities and doing more numb banking businesses like investment management walter riston at citibank trained a new breed of profit-oriented bankers who fanned out from citibank to other banks in 1972 citibank held a dinner meeting for security analysts an unheard of event [Music] as equity researcher howard mark's job is simple studying companies and forecasting their future marx excels at the job consistently making the right predictions he quickly gets promoted to the director of research the number one guy at that department but there's a lingering question did he make those forecasts correctly because he was good at it or simply because he was lucky how remarks is about to find out the hard way [Music] as the head of the equity research group at citibank howard marx is leading a team of analysts aiming to predict the directions of different stocks in america be an equity analyst is a tricky job since the u.s stock market tends to turn upward in the long run if you're always bullish you will end up being more right often than ron the challenge is to spot bear market and to spot bad companies in the mid-1970s howard mark's research group recommended a group of 50 stocks so called the nifty 50s to their clients expecting them to go up by the end of the decade but by 1979 those stocks lost 90 percent of their value so the banks invested in the nifty 50. that certainly included citibank we were the great leaders that meant ibm xerox kodak polaroid murder lilly and unlike that the great great great companies and if you would have invested in those companies the day i started work in september of 69 and held them for five years diligently you would have lost almost all your money so that taught me an important lesson i i i concluded at the time it's not what you buy it's what you pay for it how remarks realizes the reason he has gotten this far in the industry is perhaps just pure luck it may be that it is impossible to predict stock prices after all [Music] by the end of 1977 the former hotshot on wall street now has a decision to make after recommending stocks to clients that turn out to be big losers howard mark's reputation and track record are tainted he can either quit now or get fired eventually but fate intervenes over the years of working at citibank howard marx has many allies the chief investment officer at citibank recognizes how remarks is still worth a great deal to the company he decides to give marx a second chance by giving him another job my reign as director of research at citibank involved as it was with the nifty 50 was not so successful i was very fortunate the break of my life came in 1978 when i was assigned to the bond department i wanted to get into money management marx now will manage a portfolio of junk bonds a niche investment at a time but will soon explode [Music] in the 1970s the american economy is forever changed after nixon abandoned the gold standard the fed is struggling to contain the hyperinflation while others see volatility some see opportunity after earning his mba from a procedure school howard marx came to wall street hoping to build a successful career in finance but in less than 10 years his stock recommendations fell over 90 percent he now questions everything he's learned about investing is it possible to succeed in the investment business without trying to make predictions about the future he will soon find the answer in an entirely new industry junk bonds and then in august of 78 i got the call that changed my life from the head of the bond department he said there's some guy out in california named milken or something and he deals in something called high-yield bonds can you figure out what that means because a client had come in and they said we want a high yield michael milken is the king of junk bonds like marx milken joined wall street in 1969 as an investment analyst but his research centered around particularly those that are considered junk bonds compared to governments junk bonds yield a juicy five and a half percent interest rate but with that extra interest comes risk what seems great today can quickly seem terrible when the economy turns south milker realized that some of these low-grade bonds tend to be undervalued because the market tends to perceive them to be overly risky than they actually are so the risk and reward payoff makes him very attractive investment but melkin wants to have skin in a game by 1975 the head of his firm decided to give melkin capital to test its research on junk bonds a year later milken makes a hundred percent profit [Music] milken has struck gold after witnessing his incredible performance many wall street firms start following suit among them is citibank howard mark's research in equities failed to provide profitable guidance but to rectify his reputation in a company he is about to join the gold rush learning from his mistake howard marx now believes the right mentality to make an investment is not to predict when something will happen but to rely on probability and common sense i don't believe in forecasts i don't think that my efforts to be a superior investor are aided by macro forecasts if you if you're getting your information from a forecaster the fact that he was right once doesn't tell you anything the views of that forecaster would not be of any value to you unless he was right consistently and nobody's right consistently in making deviant forecasts the best analogy is the firemen department they don't know when and where the next fire will occur but they're always prepared howard marx practically becomes a value investor he discovers that when a company is in distress the market becomes overly pessimistic causing the bump price to crash the company's bond gives rated triple c's or below these are the bonds of companies that are bankrupt or they appear destined to be to go bankrupt you say well how can you possibly invest in bankrupt companies but the answer is if you get the securities so cheap you can make a lot of money even if the sat company goes bankrupt they can still recover a great value for the bondholders by selling their assets like inventories and real estate properties but if the company survives he can convert the bond to stocks and he will make great returns on his investment over the next seven years howard marks fortified his investment strategy while consistently generating profits for citibank he even moved to california to be close to michael milken and then joins a fund in los angeles tcw group compared to citibank tcw gives howard marks more autonomy and more capital to focus on distressed bonds ones that are rated even worse than typical junk bonds but even that can't satisfy his ever growing ambition three years later howard marx is ready to start his own firm what makes howard mars a great investor is that he has an in-depth understanding of the nature of uncertainty you know we have to think about the world as a probability distribution and so when you look at a historical event you have to say was that outcome inevitable or was it subject to randomness and could other things have happened just as well this idea is very well established in probability theory one of the most common traits of these great value investors is that they are more of a generalist they read and learn much more broadly brilliant.org is a great place to learn probability game theory and systems thinking what makes brilliant stand out from the rest is its emphasis on interactive learning it makes a learning process fun and more importantly it's proven to be more effective than traditional lectures the point is not to learn anything too specific it's about training yourself to think more logically and probabilistically to get started for free visit brilliant.org at phineas or click the link in the description the first 200 people will get a 20 off brilliant annual premium subscription [Music] to start a fund he'll need capital lots of it nothing short of a billion dollars will suffice even he can't bankroll that much but marx has a bold vision creating america's biggest fund that is solely designed for investing in distressed securities they're basically just two options here first is just to walk away taking away some tcw's clients we see that all the time in the font management business clients tend to be more loyal to the money manager than to the company the second way is more friendly which is to ask tcw's to invest in his new fund to leave on friendly terms and also to benefit both parties marx chooses the second way of exit but in a surprising twist tcw rejects howard mark's offer mark stern the founder of tcw feels this is the betrayal of the high's order and decides that tcw will not have anything to do with howard marks howard marx knows right now it is ugly times ugly and that's when the ugly get going [Music] tcw just had a massive loss in his mortgage back bonds a year earlier not losing more clients to hour marks will spelt doom for the company tcw may never recover after coming to his census mark stearns decides to give in to howard mark's demand and invest 2.5 billion seat capital to his new fund howard had a lot of confidence and a big bargaining chip mostly because of one man bruce karsh who is his version of charlie munger bruce karcz is one of the first to capitalize on the 80s junk bond gold rush he graduated summa laude from duke university and was on his way to becoming a lawyer after working at a corporate bankruptcy court and then as an executive assistant for the insurance company sun america bruce carr developed a king sense for value and risk as a former lawyer he knows how the bankruptcy process works and also as an insurance executive he has this ability to access risk and reward better than most in 1987 bruce carr's insurance company became a client of tcw group howard marx hired him immediately they started the 100 million dollar fund at tcw with assault focus on distressed debt but by 1994 they have outgrown their positions at tcw they dream of a fund biggest in america that is solely focused on distress investing they quit tcw and start oak trade howard marks knows his strength is that big picture philosophical thinking and communication he decides to become the public face for oaktree while bruce karcz is the quiet executioner behind the scenes they have a simple investment proposition in 95 to start archery everything we had done was about going into these risky asset classes with the risks under control and and when we drew up our investment philosophy we put risk control first consistency second after the risk is controlled with uttermost discipline they will find companies into stress situations whose investors are overwhelmed with fear when i started at the bank citibank 50 years ago they had a cartoon on the wall it said scared money never wins and it's true there's only one problem while distress investing has worked on a smaller scale no one has done it with a large amount of capital they have and that is about to change from 1993 to 1995 is the height of the dotcom bubble people rushing into the market like never before productivity improved at the fastest pace in nearly eight years at the end of 1993 and at the same time labor costs fell at their fastest rate in 10 years american businesses are thriving ipl's are almost a daily phenomena financed by easy money through the equity market and junk bonds a great number of dot-com businesses are being built from nothing after making a killing in the junk bond era howard mark started his firm oak tree with the chief lieutenant bruce cars they aimed to build the largest investment fund for investing in distressed securities such a strategy only works if there are a lot of companies on the verge of bankruptcy as the internet boom continues they are forced to wait for the next three years they focus on doing smaller deals to validate their investment theses while keeping the majority of their assets in cash by 1999 they realized the market has reached an inflection point and a surprising opportunity has come to their intention it will be an investment of a lifetime welcome to regal cinemas regal cinemas was established in 1989 in knoxville tennessee in the early 1990s it went on expansion spree acquiring smaller chains as well as building new modern multiplexes by 1996 the feds started raising interest rates in an effort to calm down the market the bond market opened lower and stayed that way throughout the day also affecting bonds today was word that the treasury would likely have to cancel three and six-month bill auctions set for monday and be unable to roll over debt coming due on wednesday the entertainment industry like the theaters is what's called a cyclical industry they're often the first to be affected by macroeconomic movement by 1999 due to a heavy debt burden regular entertainment is facing bankruptcy becomes a disaster for its shareholders no investor is willing to come to the rescue except for one while other investors run scared howard marx and bruce cars see a bargain that he cannot miss for companies like retail stores restaurant chains or theaters have a lot of physical assets like real estate and they tend to have a better chance of bouncing back than other companies howard marx teams out with a denver billionaire philip n shoots they put up 800 million dollars to purchase regal's bad debts pennies on a dollar they expect after the bankruptcy companies assets will be re-evaluated to be much higher than right now which will allow them to make a profit not only they expect the company to go bankrupt now they can actually force the company to go bankrupt the investment is a success their original 800 million swells into 3.5 billion by 2002 more than 4x their original investment people like marx are called vultures they pick pieces out of dying companies but they do play a beneficial role in the financial ecosystem which is providing money to certain companies that will save them from total collapse for vultures there's no better time to invest than during the bear market when there's a blood on the street have to be aggressive when people are depressed and defensive when people are excited in other words we have to think and feel differently from others and that's not easy we have to be either unemotional people or we have to learn the importance of emotional restraint and how to do it over the span of three years during the dot-com bubble they have more opportunity to invest in the bankrupt companies than their capital allows counter to the sentiment at a time they invest in companies that are thought to go extinct because of the internet for example they put three billion dollars in a newspaper company in a leveraged buyout deal with the notorious real estate mogul sam zell [Music] howard marks and burst cars built their fund by exploiting market recessions by early 2007 they have sensed that another bear market is coming they believe this crash may just be a typical recession but they have no idea what is about to happen it's estimated that more than two million homeowners with subprime mortgages are at risk of foreclosure and with the delinquency rate up 8 percent and rising some predict 8 out of every 10 subprime homeowners will default what was once thought to be a safe investment the mortgage-backed security market collapses it catches everyone by surprise i anticipated that it was going to happen i just didn't know exactly when but nobody forecast the 2008 crisis the easy money the gradual deep regulations since the 80s the invention of financial derivatives all contributed to this perfect storm but there's another factor we deal with type a personalities and type a personalities know everything in the world banking became a pissing contest no mine's bigger than yours that kind of stuff the wall street firm with one of the most aggressive cultures is lehman brothers at the time lehman brothers is one of the oldest investment banks on wall street its history traced all the way back to 1850. for nearly a century lehman brothers has won and lost many battles and has been targeted by many wall street titans by 1994 it regains its independence when its parent company primerica decides to spin it off lehman brothers now has a new ceo dick fold nicknamed the gorilla dick vote turns lehman around surviving the 1997 asian financial crisis but the real growth comes after 2001 when dickfield aggressively expands lima's trading business generating 3.1 billion dollars net revenue in 2003. dick fole has rebuilt lehman brothers to his own image which is all about aggressively seeking profits by any means necessary its biggest money maker comes from what used to be a boring asset mortgage-backed securities but when the tie fades lehman suddenly finds himself exposed and vulnerable what they thought was secure mortgage assets turn out to be junk worth close to zero but in spite of the trouble lehman's facing dick fo is confident that lehman brothers will survive his wall street friend now the secretary of treasury hank paulson will bail him out i made frequent calls to dickfall we had told him repeatedly that the government can't put in capital this was a tactic plain and simple if we didn't communicate that all the other wall street banks would believe that the fed you know would be there to put capital in but paulson may have underestimated the impact of lehman bankruptcies on the global financial system a day after the failure of lehman brothers and the fire sale of merrill lynch attention turned to aig the world's largest insurance company american international group is seeking emergency funding as it struggles to stay afloat i describe it as an economic pearl harbor the 1929 panic was nothing like this the system had stopped how remarks has been observing the storm unfold as far as he's concerned he doesn't have a choice but to invest we had prepared for the global financial crisis but then we also raised an 11 billion dollar fund for distressed debt investing that we put on the shelf and then we had uh lehman brothers bankruptcy on september 15th of 08 and i put out a memo a couple days later and i said look there are two states of nature either the world is going to end or it's not and if it ends it won't matter whether we bought or sold but if it doesn't end and we didn't buy then we didn't do our job how are marx and bruce cars decide to go all in buying as many distressed debts as they could get their hands on we were able to buy the debt of companies the senior debt of companies at prices which implied that those companies were worth a quarter or a fifth or a third of what some very astute buyout funds had paid for them one and two years earlier and they usually don't get it wrong by a factor of four or five so we swung into action we had the money we had the will and we had the bargains and we spent about 600 million a week but their actions are met with resistance by their investors and clients to calm them down he starts regularly writes journals and memos explaining his investing idea and philosophy to his clients and the public but the crisis of 2008 still shocks them by its severity for months oak trade continues to lose money like the rest of the country its fate hangs in the balance in spite of the pressure and doubt they continue to do one thing the motion is adopted after rejecting the bush administration's tarp plan only four days ago the house passed it today the big question now whether investors will take comfort in the news with the help of a government bailout the financial market stabilizes howard mark's investment pays off making oak trade six billion dollars from their investments during 2008. [Music] better than bruce america barely survived the 2008 housing crisis [Music] trillions of dollars of so-called assets evaporated into thin air but howard marx emerges from 2008 victorious making billions by buying distressed securities due to their fearless and disciplined approach to investing by 2011 oaktree has made 19 analyzed return since 1995. it's the perfect time to go public the success of 2008 investment allows oak tree to stand out from the crowd howard marx believes it should be easy to raise extra money by doing an ipo well the world's biggest investor in distressed debt is taking a page from its competitors we're talking about oak tree capital taking a cue from blackstone and kkr and filing for an ipo intending to raise 46 dollars a share for his oak tree capital management company surprisingly he could only raise 43 a share he may have miscalculated as a value investor you have to be a bit of contrarian and you're often betting against the same people you're trying to raise money from that is why warren buffett keeps berkshire's asia really really high as a way to filter out short-term investors once again howard marks decide to learn a lesson from warren buffett he's going to double down on his investor communication in the same year he publishes a book the most important thing marx aims to build a personal brand that draws in the right type of investors who think in long term who are brave enough to buy and resilient enough to hold his personal brand will be useful to keep his investors intact as the market is about to become extremely difficult for value investors [Music] since 2008 the u.s has had one of the longest boom in the financial history the s p 500 has grown four thousand percent since new assets are popping up retail investors become a force to be reckoned with but the longer the bulk market runs the harder it is for value investors to find bargains some even jump ships and start speculating but not warren buffett and not people like howard marks by 2022 howard marx has established himself as a wise value investor in the same league as the greats his reputation compensated for the lackluster performance of oak tree funds but nothing lasts forever marx knows the rent will eventually come due when the market does take a turn he will be ready to collect it as i've been saying for weeks i think we're in the midst of a real bear market i'm hoping that we're at least halfway through now in 2022 as the market begins to fall pipe dreams turn nightmares the vultures are ready for the hunt [Music] [Music] you"

    "content": "this video is brought to you by norwell an advanced cleaning robot that lets you stay competitive with your time melinda gates have filed for divorce ending what some consider one of the most consequential marriages in american history each tweeting a joint statement saying after a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship we have made the decision to end our marriage after 27 years the former world richest man is ending his marriage with his wife sending shockwaves to the world the high-profile divorce invites the public to speculate what will happen to his massive fortune you know what i love about bill gates i love that he has so much money that even if she cuts him in half he's still got 15 million 15 billion yeah yeah ever since gay's retirement he has been diversifying his fortune the person responsible for protecting and growing this great wealth as an investor little known to the public michael larson [Music] the fortune bill gates had before the divorce was bigger than even the top hedge funds on wall street managing bill gates wealth isn't just a full-time job for one investor it's a full-time job for an entire investment team since larson took over gabe's portfolio in 1994 he has reportedly generated a return of 11 a year slightly better than that of the s p 500 and that's not counting the incredible growth of microsoft stocks eleven percent may not seem much to certain people but larson's portfolio has much lower volatility essentially outperforming majority of other endowments out there michael larson is a mysterious figure for years he's been using a particular strategy designed for the world's richest man [Music] [Music] born in a wealthy and well-connected family bill gates is set for a great life as long as he follows his father's footsteps by becoming a lawyer but to the young bill gates he wants something different something exciting and it will require him to take huge risks since he was a teenager gates has always been fascinated by computer software but industry still in its infancy but gates thinks he can do better just like how henry ford ushered the age of automobiles bill gates envisioned himself as the man who put the computer with his software installed in every household so he drops out of the pray law program at harvard and goes all in to create his own operating system [Music] case understands the risk is worth it because he can always come back to harvard and his family will always give him a safety net bill gates first product ms-dos is an instant success when they developed that operating system for ibm ibm wanted to buy the source code which would have given them the disk operating system or what became known as das and instead microsoft refused to actually sign the rights over to dos bill gates business model is brilliant ibm will now have to pay microsoft a licensing fee for every single copy of dos installed in his computers but his biggest breakthrough comes when his company microsoft releases the windows operating system on november 20th 1985. there were all kinds of computers that were being conceived at that point in time and it struck me i don't know who will win in the hardware business but microsoft has a very good chance to win in the software by the early 1990s microsoft has virtually become a monopoly in the business of operating systems as the founder bill gates owns 45 percent of the company making him one of the youngest billionaires in the world his wealth came to him so fast and also at such a young age he didn't know what to do with them not knowing much about finance gays hires a friend of his to manage his money andrew evans but that is a mistake working as a full-time ceo at microsoft bill gates is not involved with his own personal finance and as his wealth grows people around them take notice andrew evans has been a longtime friend of bill gates he has been keeping an eye on gay's ever-growing fortune he realizes bill gates may be a genius programmer but he knows little about finance he could manage gay's new fortune and make himself rich in the process persuaded by evans bill gates hires him to invest his money and as a friend bill gates gives andrew evans full autonomy over his money it turns out andrew evans and his wife were felons who years earlier were charged with bank fraud the decision to hire andrew evans backfires on bill gates the wall street journal published an article exposing the secret past of andrew evans the damage to bill gates reputation is massive you know bill gates was young and kind of arrogant so he didn't listen to what the press had to say about him and he wanted to keep evans around but there's one person bill gates will always listen to his mother mary maxwell gates she has been a powerful businesswoman in seattle sitting on the board of many banking companies that ability to be a good board member then got her other positions on boards that actually that paid she has been instrumental in helping her son's business she knows keeping andrew evans around is a taking time bomb she instructs gays to find a new money manager and this time bill gates must do a full due diligence process a practice common in her own finance industry to not disappoint his mother bill gates now devotes his uttermost attention to finding a great money manager he's looking for a man he trusts completely in order to stay focused on microsoft and bill gates recognizes that a primary goal should be wealth protection rather than seeking great returns gaze builds a task force of headhunters with the ability to do background check like the fbi and like writing an operating system bill gates will not allow any mistake this time and soon his headhunters come back with one unusual candidate michael larson is a young up-and-comer on wall street but has already built a great track record he has a conservative investing style often keeping half his portfolio in cash and yet still outperforming the market he specializes in bond funds a scale that could help hedge the volatility of the microsoft stocks that bill gates owns that's all good but what bill gates care about the most was that this guy must not turn out to be a crook just like his pal but bill gates finds out that this guy's record is almost too clean he never broke the law not even getting a parking ticket michael larson is in his early 30s at the time and like bill gates is already an overachiever in many ways larsen is similar to bill gates but from a different background [Music] michael larson is raised in north dakota to a family of industrial engineers what do you think of when you think of north dakota cold winter small communities family lifestyle agriculture ancestors who made one-way trips from the old world to the new world from an early age larsen exhibits an above-average intelligence allowing him to skip grades i finished high school two years ahead of other students and like many young people for north dakota the 16 year old larson is desperate to get out of there so he applies to become a coast guard but to his disappointment he is too young to be qualified he now must rethink about his future careers and eventually decide to pursue a degree in economics he goes to claremont meccano college and finish it in three years he's then accepted by the university of chicago to pursue an mba degree while most students of his age still have yet to graduate college he earns his master's degree from one of the best business schools in america [Music] larson's first job is working for the finance department and oracle the 1980s is a booming decade for mergers and acquisitions at arco larson works on the financing for arcola's potential deals for big firm to acquire a company a lot of them typically borrow money from the banks or issue a lot of bonds to raise money it's a great training ground to learn how to evaluate companies and more importantly to learn how the bond market works but michael larson quickly realizes with his knowledge about the bond market he could make more money if he runs a bond portfolio himself he lends a job and partner investment managing a collection of bond funds this is still the junk bond era so a lot of bond portfolios can't do as well as equity portfolios and unsurprisingly after two years his portfolio outperforms the benchmark while just turning 30 michael larson has been in the business longer than his peers and also has built a track record better than most he decides it's about time to strike out on his own and just as he's looking to raise more money america's youngest billionaire comes calling by 1983 bill gates has capitalized on the rise of microsoft stocks and to diversify his wealth he sold 400 million dollars worth of shares he hires the 33 euro money manager michael larson and gives him all of that money to manage it's a huge display of trust michael larson has his own set of investment theories and principles he has to explain portfolio optimization in math terms and mathematical certainty is something that bill gates can trust by 1984 michael larson starts the fund cascade with only one investor on board bill gates to make one investor happy it's truly easier than to make more right larsen is about to find out making bill gates happy is no easy task after becoming the richest man in the world for many years bill case realizes that there's one commodity that is more valuable than money time he is on time to the minute every single meeting without fail time is the one commodity that he can't buy more of so gays decides to not only have michael larson handle his finances but also starts automating his own home the key factor of success for both bill gates and warren buffett is focus normal t10 is one of the most innovative cleaning robots that is quiet autonomous and more importantly it frees you from repetitive tasks so that you can stay focused on the competitive game of finance i've been using narwhal t10 for a while now and unlike other vacuum robots i got this one is really great at navigating and efficiently cleaning and mopping my apartment all on its own what really sold me on this cleaning robot is that it mocks my kitchen floor really well and it automatically cleans itself afterwards and it really saves me a lot of time and gives me a clean space to wake up to every morning to get a discount use the link in the description larson's first task is to figure out how to hedge the risk associated with bill gates microsoft stocks it's a very unique situation michael larson has a little control over bill gates ownership of microsoft stocks because gates has to have enough shares in order to have a controlling position at the company and they also can't trade microsoft stocks actively which could easily look like insider trading all he can do is to design a strategy around microsoft stocks in order to retain the returns hopefully and also reduce overall volatility it's a daunting task one that requires larsen to rethink everything he's learned about investing and when he made a deal with a richest man in america who is famous for his violent temper failure is not an option millions of shoppers across the country are rushing into stores on the hunt for big bargains this holiday season the mid-1990s is the height of the technology boom overnight success stories are constantly on the front page of the american media attracting thousands of young people into silicon valley bill gates is the personification of the kind of wealth that is possible in tech but he knows his fortune is too volatile because of his microsoft stocks he needs to find an investor that can not only safeguard his wealth but can also grow it better than others it's a difficult task given to the young wall street money manager michael larson as an expert in bond investment larsen needs to come out with a new strategy in order to diversify the risk away from microsoft stocks larson believes he must put the rest of the wealth in assets with a low correlation to stocks especially to tax stocks he decided to invest 70 percent into a mixture of short-term government and corporate bonds plus some high-yield bonds in the emerging market it's a textbook solution which might stabilize your portfolio but it doesn't guarantee any great returns the real breakthrough comes when larson realizes that to hedge against the volatility of the stocks he should get off from the public market and allocate 30 percent of the portfolio to private equity deals i generally i am somewhat skeptical of the entire ipo process i tend to think it creates exorbitant amounts of costs it creates a lot of distraction for management teams and the track record even today if you think of some of like the most iconic interesting companies of like the last year and a half that have gone public by and large has been a very mixed track record whereas you see a bunch of other great companies who choose to take alternative forms of financing and it's going really well the combination of private equity investment and a bond portfolio will allow larsen to capture the excess returns while also hedging against macroeconomic impact and now larson is ready to put bill gates money to the test [Music] over the next four years bill gates strategically sells up to five billion dollars in microsoft stocks while still maintaining his controlling position at the company he gives all of that to michael larson to manage larsen sees the u.s economy in 1995 heading for a potential tech bubble it puts 3.5 billions into u.s and foreign bonds anticipating a market correction he invests the other 1.5 billion into smaller private companies the private equity part of the investment is very diversified including a satellite startup hedge funds and some financial companies the goal is to capture the returns of equities while also avoiding the day-to-day volatility of the stock market by 1998 he has outperformed the dow jones and is well positioned for economic recession in the meantime bill gates decided to let him take over his foundation's money by 1999 bill gates has two main foundations one with five billion dollars the other one with 1.5 billion unlike a typical investment fund foundations or endowments have a unique set of constraints high up in a tower in midtown manhattan are the officers of an unique organization devoted primarily not to making money but to giving it away wise the economy goes bad the alumni stop giving the government grants dry up that's the best argument for endowments they're a buffer for the operating budget the foundations have a yearly budget and they must be very liquid so private equity investment is out of the question to larson the margin for error is thin because any money he loses from now on is the money that can be used to help the people in need saving lives once again he must come up with a different strategy from gay's personal portfolio at the time learning foundation has a 1.5 billion dollars money used to enable education around the world it's the kind of money larsen can't risk losing so he creates a mixture of short-term government and corporate fixed income securities larson will actively rebalance the portfolio based on his macroeconomic views at any given time with this portfolio larson is taking a very conservative approach he's almost guaranteed to never lose money and he's also very liquid the second foundation the william h gates foundation has 5 billion dollars larson decides to create his own version of the risk parity portfolio with 60 and short term bonds he gives 15 percent to other bond funds like penco he then trades the rest of the 25 actively with different corporate or foreign buns when he sees fit to bill gates larson's investment strategy works during the periods of dot-com bubble his fund manages to achieve a positive return while the nasdaq drops in half for early 2000 due to the anti-monopoly probe microsoft stocks lost 34 percent in five years but because of michael larsen bill gates overall fortune has been barely affected by the decline of microsoft stocks at the time his strategy seems fixed but larson is not a dogmatic person as a macro guy he knows how to ride a bullet market when he sees it used to be a fixed income manager but larson realizes after the decade of 1990s the bond market has changed uh what we see here is uh this 26 week rolling correlation of the s p 500 to interest rates and you can see that currently at least last 10 years or so the correlation has been quite positive where back you know from the 70s up until you know the late 1990s it was negative now larson will start buying more equities except they have to have a low correlation to microsoft he learns from gay's best friend warren buffett he invests a portion of the gate's portfolio in various value stocks for the long term including berkshire hathaway by 2021 bill gates overall fortune has climbed to 140 billion dollars [Music] but little does larsen know his life and his relationship with bill gates is about to be flipped upside down bill and melinda gates are joining a number of other wealthy couples splitting up after decades-long marriages theirs is reportedly an amicable one but it will be costly the surprising divorce makes the future of their foundations uncertain he also creates uncertainty about bill gates fortune while the divorce will not make bill gates a poor man it sends him further away from the list of the world's richest people but losing money is the least of bill gates concerns [Music] gates has spent decades rebuilding his reputation but after the divorce all of the efforts seemingly have gone to waste [Music] the new york times in wall street journal reporting bill gates allegedly pursued relationships with several employees prior to his wife of 27 years filing for divorce according to the journal bill reportedly engaged in a years-long sexual relationship with a microsoft engineer that began in 2000 the employee writing a letter about it which came to the board's attention in 2019 leading to an investigation gates effectively forced from his role on the board in march 2020 michael larson is caught right in the middle under the direction of melinda gates he has been slowly transferring some equity stake worth three billion dollars from bill gates to her sorry she received 851 million dollars worth of shares in farm equipment maker deering co according to sec filings she also received 2.4 billion dollars worth of stock in four other companies canadian national railway car dealership group autonation mexican coke bottler coca-cola femsa and mexican broadcaster grupo televisa larson is eagerly waiting for the day the divorce is settled so that he can get back to normal and manage the money that is left but his own crisis has just begun since bill gates reputation is ruined michael larson by association has been under more exposure and scrutiny used to have a spotless record with a law larsen now is accused of being a closet racist among many other inappropriate workplace behaviors but larson couldn't care less he only has one investor bill gates so the public scrutiny doesn't mean much to him unless bill case fires him at this point it's a greater risk for bill gates wealth to fire him after 20 plus years and trying to find a new guy but bill gates and larson are in the same boat in spite of the damages to the reputation in the long run one thing is certain they will continue to get wealthier i want to thank norwolf for sponsoring this video and for this great little guy and i highly recommend it it's going to be a great investment for your time and money [Music] you"

    "title": "Jamie Dimon - The Most Powerful Banker in America | Full Documentary",
    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkHbB9GuCkE",
    "content": "It's the end of the 2009 housing crisis. The once-in-a-lifetime financial storm has caused dozens of banks to fail. But there's one bank, not only surviving the crisis unscathed, but also capitalizing on this opportunity to become the largest bank in America. JP Morgan Chase. Sitting on the throne of this financial empire, is the Wall Street banker, Jamie Dimon. [Music] [Music] Jamie Dimon is born into the finance business. In 1921, his grandfather came to New York with nothing, but soon built a successful career as a banker, and then as a stock broker. By the time Jamie was born, his father, Theodore Dimon, also, has become a wealthy stockbroker. Well you know what my parents were real moralists, so you, they, you know, you do the right thing, you only do the right thing, you treat people, everyone, equally and fairly. My mom was one of the earliest women's libbers, around after reading, uh, you know some of those, uh, books and stuff like that. Dimon's childhood is almost too perfect, attending private schools and spending summers in the mountains in Colorado. His life has been the envy of other children of the same age, but to the young Jamie, it isn't enough. From day one, Jaime has an unwavering ambition. He wants to make a fortune - more than that of his father and grandfather. He recognized early on, that to succeed achieving this goal, he should be in the finance industry. But first, he should go to a great college. But, to his dismay, he's rejected by his dream school, Brown University. After graduating fourth in his class, and being rejected by Brown University, Dimon goes to Tufts University instead. Jamie Dimon grew up having most things handed to him. Deep down he believes Tufts doesn't deserve a student of his caliber. During his freshman year, he applied to be transferred to Princeton University, but Dimon is rejected again by an Ivy league school. Jamie Dimon feels he's entitled to go to the best school in America. He decides the best way to prove he's worthy of greatness, is by becoming the #1 student at Tufts. Jamie Dimon always seemed to have this supreme confidence, and sometimes comes off as cocky. His plan worked. By 1978, Dimon graduates Summa Cum Laude from Tufts, and is accepted to the Harvard business school. He finally achieved his goal, and his self-worth is validated. At Harvard, Dimon proves once again he's in the league of his own. In business school, Dimon was a non-conformist. He didn't live on campus like other students, and he wore jeans and leather jackets. Other students wear suits. In a class full of republicans, he was the only democrat, and a very vocal one. Jamie Dimon graduates Harvard as a baker scholar - an honor only bestowed on the top 5% of his class. Dimon is flooded with job offers by many prestigious investment banks on Wall Street. His future is bright. Surprisingly, Dimon turns them all down, and instead decides to take 1/3 of the salary by working for a family friend, the legendary financier, Sandy Weill. I got to know him a little bit, my dad was a broker at Shearson Hammill, I had a summer job there, uh, you know, he liked the fact that I went to Harvard business school, and, and, his pitch was this, I'm not gonna pay you the same, but, he said, come join me here, I don't know what it's gonna be, uh, but at least you'll see what a big company works like. Sandy Weill is an accomplished deal maker in the finance industry. During his long career, he changed the fate of many iconic Wall Street brands, like Primerica, Salomon Brothers, and Citibank. Born in a Jewish neighborhood, in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, Sandy Weill always wanted to get rich, not by working a 9-5 job, but by creating his own company, and leveraging other people's money. By 1986, he sold his brokerage firm, Shearson, to American Express, for $900 million dollars. He becomes the president of American Express. He takes a liking to the young Jamie Dimon, and offers to hire him as his personal assistant. Like most young people who get breaks, luck has a lot to do within the timing, and the second factor besides timing, is that, as a young man, usually all of us would admit that there was a mentor, a benefactor, and when an older person who you respect and admire has confidence in you, it's a great booster to your own self-confidence. What I loved about, first of all he was, he was very down to earth, I mean, there are flaws in the man but he's very down to earth. I really wanted to help build something, I mean, that was my initial thing like I wanted to build something. He had built Shearson Hammill, from the you know, just the Hayden Stone, they had a lot of acquisitions kind of from the ground up, I love that kind of story. So I, I figured I could always go back to investment banking. I think Jamie Dimon realized that Sandy Weill was Genghis Khan at his early stage of conquest. He saw him as someone he could emulate, to build his own empire. While other MBA graduates will have to work from the bottom up, Sandy Weill brings Jamie Dimon right to the inner circle of his operation, negotiating deals on behalf of Weill, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. At the age of 28, Jamie Dimon already feels he's at the top of the finance game. But that is only temporary. Before long, fate will bring him down to rock bottom. The 1980's is a decade of deal making. After Ronald Reagan became the president, he prioritized helping corporate America, cutting taxes and making it easy for them to borrow money. This gives rise to the mergers and acquisitions, or simply, deals. Only good deals. [Music] After landing a job working directly for the president of American Express, Jamie Dimon's career skyrockets. Sandy Weill aims to become the #1 guy at American Express. Jamie Dimon knows, if he can help his mentor accomplish that, someday, American Express will also be his. But their ambition makes them targets. At the time, American Express owns a fund called, Fireman's Fund. Sandy Weill wanted to sell it to Warren Buffett, and he and Jamie Dimon worked tirelessly to make this deal happen. But at the final stage, the board vetoed this idea. Sandy Weill realizes he was played, and quit American Express in anger. But he encourages Dimon to stay on, because Dimon needs to support his new family. In 1985, I decided to leave there because I had a difference of, in management, uh, style. I, I left not knowing what was going to happen next, but you know American Express stock for the, for the four years that I was there, uh, tripled, so, uh, I did okay, and we, I started looking for something else to do. But in a show of loyalty, the 29 year old Dimon quits his job too. Jamie Dimon, who worked for me, was a very loyal guy, and he wanted to go with me even though American Express wanted him to stay, but he, he felt this is what he wanted to do, I said Jamie, you were voted most likely to succeed in business school, how the heck can you be going with an older guy? You know I don't have to work again another day in my life. It's an incredible gamble - one that will pay off handsomely in the end. But for now, they must come up with a new plan. After his fall from grace, the unyielding Sandy Weill is determined to make a comeback, with Dimon on his side. At the age of 58, his peers see Sandy Weill as someone on the way out. No Wall Street firms want to hire him as their executive. It's a mistake they will come to regret. In the meantime, Sandy Weill and Dimon are forced to look elsewhere for deals. They're looking to take over a smaller company, then leverage it to take over bigger companies, and before long they find just the company, from an unlikely place. Commercial Credit is a loan company in Baltimore, targeting middle and lower class consumers, those who shop at Walmart. It was pretty much a loan shark operation -  lending high-interest short-term loans to mostly a low income population. Commercial Credit's parent company is a computer disk drive maker called Control Data. It was a bizarre acquisition, doomed to fail from the get-go. By 1985, Control Data is in financial trouble, and is ready to sell the child company for cash. Sandy Weill instructs Jamie Dimon to analyze the firm for a potential takeover, and he comes back with a shocking finding. Jamie Diamond is always the type who thinks differently from other people. Commercial Credit was a crappy company, with just 4% return on equity, while similar companies have 15%. But Dimon realized that the company has a lot of assets that they can sell, a lot of costs to be cut, basically making it a very attractive bargain. They approach Warren Buffett again for investment. But to Buffett, the days of owning cigar butt companies are long gone. His partner, Charlie Munger, convinced Buffett to focus on quality companies to invest in, rather than trying to turn around bad ones. And he'd been taught by Ben Graham, but he saw the point. He couldn't scale that business. And it was kind of scroungy, and unpleasant, and you're firing people. Who in the hell wants to do that? So Buffett rejects their offer. The deal is now on the verge of falling out. Their plan of an epic comeback now seems impossible. In this situation, there are three possible ways to take over this company. The first is to look for a wealthy co-investor, like Warren Buffett, but that didn't work out. The second way is to do a leveraged buyout, by borrowing a lot of money, plus some equity, to fully take over the company. But the company would immediately have a heavy debt burden, risking bankruptcy. The third option is to do a public offering, by selling a portion of the ownership to the public. The challenge is to convince investors to buy. Jamie Dimon sees Commercial Credit as an undervalued company that can be turned around by someone like him, making it an attractive investment. Sandy Weill decided to put the majority of his own fortune, by buying 10% of the company, and offering 80% of the company to the public. Jamie Dimon, while barely in his early 30's, invests everything he's got - $425 thousand dollars, into the company. They raised $850 million dollars, instantly making their investment profitable. Sandy Weill also decides to appoint Dimon as the company's chief financial officer, and gives Dimon a large number of stock options as a reward for his loyalty. We took that company public, we sold, they sold 80% of the company, we raised enough money to get the company an investment grade credit rating, which\n318\n00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,.820\na finance company needed. [Music] After taking over Commercial Credit, Weill and Dimon start ruthlessly cutting costs, laying off 10% of the employees on the first day. After just one year of running the business, they create $100 million dollars in profit, and achieve a 18% return on equity. Credit agencies increased the company's credit rating, allowing Weill to borrow an extra $100 million dollars on behalf of the company. With all that money in their hands, now they can do the one thing they have come to Baltimore to do - deals. But before they can start, their company's stock suddenly collapses by 50%. That day is October 19th, 1987. Panic, crash free fall, meltdown. They just put their hands in their pockets and stared in disbelief. Every crisis of this type, whether it's 2008 or 1873, it's got the same roots. Namely, that it was unanticipated. So a necessary condition for crisis, is nobody expects it. While many of the biggest companies and countries struggle to survive, Weill and Dimon see an opportunity. Their belief in the survival of the fittest kick in. With a strong balance sheet, Commercial Credit is simply fitter than anybody else. They start buying back their shares cheaply, and take over struggling firms, next to nothing. Over the next decade, they become the most prolific deal makers. They even managed to devour a bigger company - an insurance company called Primerica, with Jamie Dimon as the architect behind the deal. By the end of the century, they have created the biggest financial conglomerate in America - Citigroup. On October 8th, the official merger date arrived, and chairman and co-CEO's, John Reed, and Sandy Weill, were on hand to greet customers and employees at Citibank's 399 Park Avenue branch. As the CEO of Citigroup Sandy Weill is now the king of Wall Street, and Dimon becomes the president of Citigroup. But his real responsibility, is at managing the investment funds of Citigroup. Jaime Dimon is only one step away from becoming the most powerful man in finance. He knows it's only a matter of time until he becomes the CEO of Citigroup. But Sandy Weill has a different idea. [Music] The 1990's is a decade of an economic boom. For the first time, the United States has a budget surplus. Although Clinton is a democrat president, he manages to cut taxes on capital gains and real estate. Sandy Weil is the apex predator of Wall Street. With his political influence, he manages to get the Clinton administration to create the Financial Service Modernization Act, allowing the merger of commercial banks with insurance companies. The age of mega banks is here. Sandy Weill rewards his protege, the young and ambitious Jamie Dimon, by making him the president of Citigroup. But for Dimon, it's not enough. He wants his mentor's seat at the table. He knows it's only a matter of time until he gets what he's entitled to. But as a master deal maker, Sandy Weill always has a plan b. He realized that although Jamie Dimon is a skilled and intelligent businessman, he's often too blunt, and has a big temper. These traits can make him vulnerable as the CEO of Citigroup. As a backup plan, Sandy Weill brings in his daughter, Jessica Bibilowicz, and puts her in Dimon's division. Jessica and Jamie are childhood friends, but their friendship is about to be tested. While initially Dimon welcomed Weill's daughter by promoting her to the chairman of the company's mutual fund division, seeing the rise of low-fee mutual funds like Vanguard, Dimon believes that traditional high-cost mutual funds will fail eventually. He instructs Jessica to reshuffle her business, and start doing the low-cost mutual funds business. Sandy Weill objects to the idea, but Dimon eventually prevails. A year later when the time comes for promotion, Jamie Dimon does not give Jessica a promotion, because he believes she didn't do a good job. In 1996, for example, Jessica's mutual fund division brought in just $288 million dollars in net assets, compared with $3.1 billion in Merrill Lynch. In Dimon's defense, he's always preaching about treating people equally, so he didn't give Jessica any favors. Treat all people properly with respect, treat them all the same, whether they're clerks or CEOs. I, someone must have mentioned yesterday that's true, but you treat them more badly sometimes, but don't treat them well, but treat them equally. But to Sandy Weill, his daughter is being alienated by Jamie Dimon. Dimon's ambition has gotten the better of him. If he can't handle relationships with his employees, how can he ever become a great CEO of Citigroup? Citigroup stock topped the New York exchange active list, and fell 7/8 to 46 and 1/8 on news of a corporate restructuring and a management shake-up, which included the resignation of president Jamie Dimon. You know, look, I worked for Sandy for 14 years, I didn't get along for the last five. I always thought it was going to get better. I obviously was wrong, because I walked in one day and he fired me. In November, 1998, after 15 years of partnership with his mentor Sandy Weill, Jamie Dimon is fired. I went home, I told my wife and children, I called my wife up and said, Judy, I'm going to tell you something, I'm not kidding, cuz I always make jokes about things like that, but I wanted to make sure the kids were fine, I went home, I have three wonderful daughters, they were much younger then, I said, the oldest, youngest one, said, dad do we have to sleep in the streets? I said, no hon we're okay. I remind people when you fail at something, it's your, I tell people about Citigroup was my net worth, not my self-worth, and I was able to move on, and yes it was difficult. Dimon was one step away from becoming the most powerful man on Wall Street, but now he is unemployed. He was doing very well, and he thought he was ready to run the company, and he probably was. The only problem was, I wasn't ready to retire. And then, you know, so, we began to not cooperate, and uh, that was not a good way to try and run a business. Jamie Dimon is no stranger to failure. Over the years of corporate conquest with Sandy Weill, Dimon has built a strong reputation as an effective corporate leader. Dimon believes he's robbed of his right to become the CEO of Citigroup. Truth be told, without Dimon, Sandy Weill would not have made such a comeback. The best revenge is through massive success. Dimon will build an empire bigger than Citigroup. And to do that, he will need to find a business as his launching pad, just like what he did with Commercial Credit. By 1999, to Dimon's surprise, a perfect opportunity lands at his doorstep. You've got one, you've probably got more than one, and chances are one of yours is one of ours. Bank One is a badly run financial conglomerate based in Chicago. Bank One was not doing well. At the time, its' credit card was rated the worst in the industry, because of bad customer service and hidden fees. Bank One's CEO, John McCoy, nicknamed Fly-By McCoy, is known to go on lavish vacations, while the company has poor earnings. The board fires McCoy, and is urgently looking for a wartime CEO to take his place. As far as the board is concerned, there is only one man capable of turning the bank around - Jamie Dimon. [Music] To show he means business, Jamie Dimon goes all in, virtually putting all of his fortune in Bank One stocks, worth over $50 million dollars. There's one rule I have, I call it skin in the game, is that nobody should put others at risk without having harm to himself. Okay? In other words, if you lose money to your clients, you should be exposed to the same risk. Dimon gambles his future on Bank One, but he may have underestimated just how bad the company is. Bank One was much tougher than JP Morgan. I mean not even close. It was failing, the stocks were down, people, everyone hated each other, uh, you know, we had a, I probably had to lay off a lot of people, and, you know, you have to fix a company. To beat the company into shape, Dimon will have to do things no one is willing to do. Over the next 12 months, he sells underperforming businesses, he cuts executive compensation, and he fires 12,000 employees to cut costs. I took away their cars, their clubs, their SERPs, their SERPs, their 401k matches, I took away their matching gift programs, the financial planning, you know, and, they weren't that happy, but I met with the rooms like this, I said, because those are entitlements. We're going to lay off people. You're in good shape, they aren't, and we collectively, are to blame, and I want you to stand forward and be proud that you're cutting your stuff first. He took $4.4 billion dollars in write-downs and loan loss provisions in 2000, and the company ended up posting a loss of $511 million dollars for the year. You would think such a loss is bad news for the company stocks, but no, Wall Street is liking what Dimon is doing. The stock goes up, because, they finally see someone who is willing to do what it takes. Jaime Dimon has one objective - building a fortress balance sheet. If your balance sheet is a fortress, a real one, not one that you've convinced yourself of, but one with assets that really have value, right? That you're not leveraged in in an extraordinary manner, you will be prepared for shock absorption. A year later, Bank One posts an astounding $2.6 billion dollars profits. With sheer will, Jamie Dimon has turned this company around from the brink of collapse. But the true goal has always been to have a strong balance sheet with lots of cash in order to do deals - massive deals. And in 2002, just after the  dot com bubble, Dimon is ready for the hunt. From the late 1999, and early 2000, the Federal Reserve raises interest rates six times in order to have a soft landing from the overheated economy. But the dot com bursts nonetheless, with NASDAQ cut in half. To make matters worse, the 9/11 attack triggers the crash of the broader stock market. The market only rebound by the fourth quarter of 2003. While the S&P 500 barely makes it to double digit returns in three years, under Jamie Dimon's management, Bank One stocks achieves 59% return, three times that of the market. By 2003, Bank One is among the only few banks that are thriving. Since his exile from Citigroup, Jamie Dimon has been biding his time and patiently plotting his comeback. He has established a reputation as a cutthroat turnaround guy, willing to do anything to make a company survive. It is that kind of quality that one particular Wall Street bank is looking for. [Music] [Music] JP Morgan was founded by the notorious banker, J. Pierpont Morgan. Morgan, also born in a banking family, was always destined for success. JP Morgan was really an extraordinary character. He was steely eyed, determined, very smart, and somebody who had that characteristic, \"I will take charge\" and he did. But by 2003, after a century of transformation, JP Morgan Chase has become a sleeping giant. The collapse of the deal between Enron and Dynegy has left Enron employees stunned, many of them wondering if they'll be getting their next paycheck. The Enron scandal cost JP Morgan $135 million dollars in fines, and a negative public image. The current CEO, William Harrison, is at his retirement age. He knows, to reverse the fortune of JP Morgan Chase, the company must find a man just like it's founder, J. Pierpont Morgan. By the start of 2003, he finds such a man. At the time, both Bank One and JP Morgan are looking to do deals. From a business perspective, it's a great fit, because JP Morgan can use Bank One to strengthen its branch banking business. But what really makes the deal attractive, is acquiring Jamie Dimon as the successor to William Harrison. Unlike Sandy Weill, William Harrison is not a power hungry person. He doesn't feel threatened by Dimon. In fact, he made it clear that Dimon would become the CEO once the merger is completed. JP Morgan Chase merges with Bank One, and after one year of consolidation, Jamie Dimon officially becomes the CEO of JP Morgan Chase - then the second largest bank in America, second to Citigroup. But not for long. What many people don't know, is that JP Morgan is among the oldest and most established institutional collectors of blue chip contemporary art. It's a tradition established by none other than the founder, J. Pierpont Morgan, himself. Even today, JP Morgan holds over $900 million dollars across 30,000 works of art in their collection. And it's not just to look at. Contemporary art prices have outpaced the S&P 500 by 164% from 1995 to 2021, while having low correlation to any major asset class. If you have been watching the videos of this channel, you may realize that a lot of these great investors and traders invest in these types of attractive assets. But, I'm not Jamie Dimon, nor JP Morgan, I don't have millions of dollars to invest in art. That is until I found Masterworks, the unicorn investment platform. Now I can just pull up Masterworks' site and invest, choosing from a catalog of offerings backed by physical multi-million dollar art. Naturally, they're an ideal partner for my channel, so anybody who uses FINAiUS link gets the priority access to their platform, where you can invest in art, like me, and JP Morgan. I highly recommend you check out that link in the description of this video. [Music] After taking the reign of JP Morgan, he starts reshaping JPM in his usual style - cutting costs, reforming incentive structure, and most importantly, creating a fortress balance sheet. But that is not enough. Wall Street only cares about profit - how much money you're making. To beat Citigroup in the marketplace and become the #1 on Wall Street, JPM will have to make more money. But Dimon realizes it is not an easy task, as the market is getting irrationally exuberant, and Citigroup is the lead dancer in the housing boom. Chuck Prince of Citibank famously said, that we have to dance until the music stops. Actually music had stopped already when he said that. But Dimon knows, and all he has to do is to watch from the sidelines, and Chuck Prince will run Citigroup to the ground, and Dimon will be ready to pick up the pieces. If there is one defining business story of the year, it is the housing slump that will be noted by historians as the biggest financial story of 2007. Just five years after recovering from the dot com bubble, the American economy finds itself in a bigger recession. This time, it's the housing market. The first bank to fail is Bear Stearns. Wall Street woke up this morning only to face a bad dream. Investment giant, Bear Stearns, one of the most admired firms in America, now one of the most endangered. Just a year before, Bear Stearns made a record-breaking profit through the business of subprime loan securitization, which connects trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans with investors all over the world. They thought by using financial derivatives, the risk was eliminated, but all they did was shifting or hiding the risk. When Bear Stearns is on the verge of collapse, the government steps in and looks for a fit financial company to bail it out. There's only one company on Wall Street with the least exposure to subprime loans. [Music] Ever since Jamie Dimon took over JP Morgan Chase, he has been reducing their exposure to subprime mortgage loans. Immediately, and we, and then we had more capital, more liquidity. The chance of having a run at JP Morgan was basically zero, and we never lost money in a quarter. That's why I called it a fortress balance sheet. At the time, the federal government didn't quite grasp the gravity of the situation. Of course the republican president didn't want to nationalize a bank. That's something only democrats would do. We bought Bear Streans, and it wasn't bailed out by the government, the government did a little bit of financing, but they acted like they financed by the guys but not. We, we did the whole thing. They took virtually no risk the way we structured for them, it just reduced, reduced the balance sheet we were taking on, and we thought we were helping the system. We only did it because we were asked to by Hank Paulson, and we thought if it went down, that could be a huge crisis for the globe. The shrewd banker he is, Jamie Dimon offers it $2 a share. Bear Stearns, the Wall Street legend, in business for 85 years, is being sold to JP Morgan Chase for just $2 a share. To put that in perspective, last year, Bear's shares were selling for $170. But the offer is considered too small. To calm the shareholders of Bear Stearns, the company sold to JPM at $10 per share. While in the end, buying Bear Stearns does not benefit JP Morgan's bottom line, this deal certified JP Morgan's reputation, as a sound bank to do business with, and it sends Jamie Dimon to the very top of the financial industry. [Music] By the end of 2008, Jamie Dimon is practically the last man standing. The house of Morgan, is now the house of Dimon. Compared to other banks at the time, JP Morgan Chase is viewed as safer, almost becoming the bank of last resort. His money market management business takes in $200 billion dollars in 2008 alone. His commercial banking division has increased income by 27% in 2008, while the rest of the country is gripped by recession. But for Citigroup, it's a different story. After Sandy Weill retired, he left City to the hands of Chuck Prince, but it proved to be a mistake. Their heavy exposure to troubled mortgage-backed securities has caused the bank to be among the first to be in trouble in 2007. The board removes Chuck Prince immediately, and replaces him with Vikram Pandit. But it is already too late. The damage is done. Sandy Weill has been watching the storm unfold in his retirement. He realizes firing Jamie Dimon is perhaps the worst mistake of his career. If you could go back, would you wish that some of what happened hadn't happened, and that he had been there instead of Chuck Prince? Oh I think there's no question. You wish you were there? Oh sure. [Music] They have a complicated relationship, like father and son, but I'm sure Sandy Weill is also secretly proud of what Jamie Dimon has accomplished. By 2020, Jamie Dimon once again is the last man standing. He now is the only CEO left on Wall Street who survived the 2008 recession. I think what separates Jamie Dimon from other business leaders, is that he's a very principled person. What you see is what you get. He has a list of values that he believes in, and he treats everyone the same based on those values, including himself. Don't pander to the bullshit that you hear from people all the time, get up every day, do the best you can, tell the truth, fight every day, wear the, I put the jersey on at JP Morgan, every single day, and you know, if we make a mistake we should admit it.

discipline and an unorthodox investment strategy he turned his humble upbringing into billions [Music] phineas [Music] stanley draco miller is raised in ordinary middle class household in philadelphia but there's nothing ordinary about the guy even from an early age people noticed that he was unusually smart and also kind of eccentric even as a young man dracula dreams of something better and taking a chance but he knows he will have to do it his own way in spite of his intelligence stanley dracumela was not accepted to an ivy league school he goes to a liberal arts college in maine instead but to pay for his expenses he opens a hot doc stand on campus this entrepreneurial experience given a more practical understanding of how business works i think this is one of his hallmark traits which is that he learns by doing rather than from theories miller excelled in college he becomes a ph.d candidate for economics at university of michigan but he quickly finds his courseworks too theoretical and impractical i took economics just so i could read the paper intelligently i went to get a phd in economics and i went there i said these people are crazy they're trying to shove the economy into a math formula it doesn't make any sense we have to be honest with ourselves that a lot of math has crept in for purposes of intimidation to make cryptic which is otherwise simple and to create a kind of interference competition where the field could be restricted to a smaller number of players so i think that there's a tremendous amount of abuse of mathematics draco miller realizes the phd program isn't going to teach him how to make money the only way to become rich is by actually playing a game of market he leaves the phd program and becomes a stock analyst for pittsburgh national bank and pnc's daily dracumela learns the art of chart reading also known as technical analysis technical analysis is the analysis of stock prices or maybe other speculative asset prices by looking at charts of the prices and looking for patterns that suggest movements in prices [Music] although most investors disregard technical chart patterns as useless dracula believes there's always a practical explanation behind them he doesn't look at a chart as some abstract lines for example during a bear run there tend to be a falling wedge pattern darker mellow believes that patterns like this are not random instead they represent the behavior of real traders behind them as a practitioner dracumela will use any technique as long as it makes some money he quickly masters

also i was a little cocky and eric and i was 25 years old so when i walked in he said to me do you know the reason i'm promoting you above all these people i said no he said for the same reason they sent 18 year olds to work you're too stupid and young to know not to charge dracula miller becomes a market wizard for pnc bank and regularly gets invited to give talk to finance professionals impressed by drug miller a wealthy investor offers him ten thousand dollars a month just to consult with him it goes to show how much people wanted to listen to his views on the market he also realizes that if people are willing to pay him that much just to speak with him he could very well start his own fund he raised one million dollars at the age of 28 truckee miller started his own hedge fund duquesne capital in 1981 in a dangerously unstable market it will be a true test of his ability the decade of 1970s is known for its out-of-control inflation earlier president nixon abandoned the gold standard destabilizing the currency by the end of it the economic suffering of the middle class has led to the election of a populist president ronald reagan but during the first year as a president his policy doesn't seem to work an economic crisis is looming behind every crisis there's an opportunity after starting his hedge fund at the age of 28 stanley druckenmiller is ready to make a fortune by riding this financial storm inflation is our friend people don't like to raise interest rates it's not very popular and there was some resistance and fear of creating a recession and so forth the trick of investing sometimes is not about predicting a future event it's about knowing how much other people know about this event so in this case drucker miller buys a lot of long-term bonds because people don't yet realize about this crash and when they know a crash is coming they will bid up the price of long-term bonds and drucker miller is set to make a fortune draco miller's bare play pays off by may 1982 an economic recession has fully materialized he makes almost 50 profits and more investors start giving their money to this young hedge fund manager with a total of seven million dollars assets under management finance is an interconnected game sometimes it's impossible to fully avoid the ripple effect of a crash although dracumela made great returns one of his consulting clients went bust his phone lost a major income source to pay for his overheads druckenmello is forced to sell 25 percent of his management company to raise 150 grand [Music] it turned out his difficulty was only temporary a year later his fund grows to 40 million dollars once unable to pay for its college tuition now draco miller is about to make more money than what he could possibly dream of like all investment funds mutual funds started out by delivering impressive returns to their investors in the early 1980s funded by the dynamic investor jack dreyfus dreyfus funds is one of the pioneers in the mutual fund industry but as any industry grows competition leads to lower profits drivers fears that if their fund does not outperform the market it will go under they must find someone who represents a new breed of investors who aren't indoctrinated by the old investing paradigm stanley druckenmiller seems to be the most likely candidate for them but he isn't about to quit his own profitable fund and joins dreyfus dreyfus is willing to accept any conditions from him as long as he agreed to run their fund from drivers perspective they're looking at druckenmiller as a money-making machine that could double or triple their assets in just a few years hiring druckenmiller is a genius move at dreyfus he actively trades stocks bonds and currencies his performance outshines every other money manager at the company draco mello continues to hone his unique trading strategy which is a combination of valuation and technical analysis determined to get the most out of this young talent drivers decide to let him take over five funds all at the same time by the end of 1986 all of them are up at least 40 percent it's hard to see that kind of returns today for essentially a collection of mutual funds reagan's economic policies led to a boom in the stock market they love the fact that shoppers are out in full force and say business has never been better with an audacious trading strategy druckenmiller makes tens of millions of profits for a mutual fund company called dreyfus his use of technical analysis allows him to time the market a skill mastered by few but what worked in the past may fail to work today that seemed to be the issue with chart rating because the market doesn't always react the same way especially during periods of extreme volatility drunken miller is about to learn this lesson the hard way trading is a competitive game to have an edge over your opponents it all comes down to information i want to thank the

knows the market is set for a correction a bubble is destined to burst eventually to pull the trigger on shorting the market he needs to verify that his technical indicators are in place but on friday october 16 1987 he sees all the technical signals to suggest that the bolt run will continue for a while since the dow has come down to 2200 from 2700 he believes it was oversold and that there's a tremendous support near that 2200 level it will likely go up the next monday so he goes all in in the stock market and even borrows 30 percent to boost his potential returns he executes his trades just before the market closes and has to meet his mentor george soros [Music] like draco miller sorrows has built a strong bold position on the market hoping to catch one last ride before it crashes during the meeting soros shows a report to druckenmiller written by relatively unknown money manager paul tudor jones in the report jones demonstrates a historical pattern that draco miller was unaware of paul tudor jones convincingly laid out his argument that a crash is imminent trucker miller falls into a great panic he devices an exit plan come next monday morning if the dow drops anything below 30 points he will sell his entire position fortunately that morning the market didn't quite grasp that a storm is here it actually bounced back from that negative 200 points for truckee miller he got out without losing much money he actually went net short by the end of october 1987 wall street is in ruins even sorrows lost 200 million dollars but drucker miller's fund actually went up all thanks to his quick actions to colossus on that fateful morning of 1987. most investors lack discipline they get excited when things are great in a situation and it's usually already in the price i think as long as you're disciplined and you stick to it you make money um i have the polar opposite investment philosophy i'm a um put all your eggs in one basket and watch the basket carefully even though sorrows lost money on black monday drucker miller's admiration for him hasn't diminished george soros is perhaps the greatest speculator in finance in his first decade running his quantum fund he achieved three thousand percent return the 1987's crash makes sorrows want to retire sorrows knows without audacious risk-taking his fund's performance would diminish he needs to find someone to take his place impressed by dracumela's ability to time the market soros believes he is a perfect successor drunken miller independently discovers that there is a dance between market fundamentals and its price it is like sorrel's theories of reflexivity which holds that there is a feedback mechanism between market fundamentals and market pricing at age 36 stanley druckenmiller becomes the second most important guy in quantum fund but to become number one he needs to impress his boss even more soon historical world event will present him an opportunity to do just that with the berlin wall coming down the deutsche mark falls with it draco miller sees this as the best opportunity to bite the marks typically when there's a budget deficit increase of a country is currency value tends to decrease but there is an exception to this role in sars book the alchemy of finance he argues that physical deficit plus expressionary physical policy plus tight monetary policy equals increase of currency value the wall came down i had a very very strong belief that germans were obsessed with inflation and when the wall came down and it looked like they're going to merge with east germany the world's thesis was this is going to be terrible for the deutsche mark my thesis was the bundesbank is the most powerful institution in germany the public's obsessed with inflation and they will do whatever it takes on the right side to keep that currency strong and there's no way the deutsche market's going down in fact the place is going to grow like a weed with all this labor from eastern germany he goes all in building a position worth two billion dollars [Music] we were all revolutionaries and the revolution has been a success 1989 is the last year of reagan's presidency under his role america has been on the roller coaster ride leaves the oval office with a 220 billion dollars deficits the us economy is at a turning point after just three years running the quantum fund by 1992 miller has nearly tripled the funds assets solely for organic growth a record surpassing that of even sorrows himself as the u.s economy is shaking and the world gets more chaotic drucker miller is ready to capitalize [Applause] on when europe got together to form the eurozone i think it was probably one of the greatest accomplishments of mankind ever it was an amazing thing that all those countries after centuries of war not just world war ii and world war one but no napoleonic wars franco-prussian wars hundred years of war war the roses 30-year war got together and you think you can hold hands and say let's learn to live in peace to force the eu as a collective economy they set up erm the exchange rate mechanism in 1979 hoping to gradually transition to a single currency but western europe is a collection of countries with vastly different cultures some value hard work and discipline while others value leisure but by 1992 strong currencies like french franc and germany mark carry the rest of the weak currencies but joining the erm failed to bring instant prosperity britain had already been sliding into recession over the next 18 months it got much worse after britain suffers a recession it becomes harder to maintain the ratio of pounds against german mark to save their economy the bank of england will have to print more money which breaks the erm or the british economic suffering will get even worse typically when a central bank prints more money the currency value will decrease and the stock market will go up this is what should happen with britain but the central bank is very hesitant to act a crisis is brewing to drug and miller this is a potential killing of a lifetime just before pulling a trigger he consults sorrows i'll never forget i walked into his office and told him the fund at the time was seven billion dollars that i wanted to put a seven billion dollar position on um along along the deutsche mark and short the pound i explained my reasoning to him which i thought was very sound he looked at me with like the most disgusted look and i was getting angry just with the with the body language feedback i was getting and he said look um you only get an opportunity like this this is a one-way bet maybe two three times in your career and you're just not betting enough i we shouldn't put 100 of the fund in this trade we should put 200 percent of the fund in the trade because the most you can lose it is a half a percent and you can make 20 in it so your risk reward is tremendous and i said go for the jugular go for the kill rather than simply shorting the weak currencies he also bets on the security markets that will be affected by the currency realignments by september 10th after sorrows and dracula fully execute their trades they wait today has been an extremely difficult and turbulent day the government has concluded that britain's best interests serve by suspending our membership of the exchange rate metals when a dust settles quantum fund pocketed one billion dollars profit under drug and miller's management quantum fund goes up 69 in 1992 at 72 percent a year later hiring druckenmiller was the best investment decision made by george soros drucker miller has made more money for sorrows than he could have made himself by 1999 quantum fund has grown to have 8.2 billion dollars assets based on their past performance they can make another two billion dollars the year after except the market has changed such a change will throw everything they learned about the market out of the window and make them rethink about what it means to be a traitor computers are supposed to make life easier about one in three american households has bought that theory and purchased a pc by the late 1990s the age of information has dawned if if you don't get on this technology boom if you don't compete if you just kind of look around and resent that you're falling behind you're gonna just be left in the dust you're gonna miss the whole thing even though sorrows and draco miller have been making ungodly amount of money using their knowledge of the market they are unaware that a deeper change is happening the effect of technology and information is a pattern they haven't seen before in 1998 dracumela realizes tech stocks represent an opportunity for a massive return based on his knowledge of stock patterns he makes a healthy profit that year by the start of 1999 he doubles down but he ignores one factor small retail investors have flooded in as never before that was virtually a new development on wall street before that the players in finance are professionals whom druckey miller understands he knows their behavior and made a bloody fortune out of it the massive participation of retail investors makes the market structurally unstable from its peak in 2000 the nasdaq technology index had lost three quarters of its entire valley draco miller certainly finds himself in an unfamiliar situation by april 29 2000 quantum fund is down 22 percent for the year in january of 2000 after writing that tech home to a tee and making billions of dollars in 99 i sold everything out in january and i had a couple of internal portfolio managers at soros who didn't sell out and they had these it was a smaller portfolio but they made 30 after i sold and i just couldn't stand it anymore i'm like watching them make all this money every day and like for two days i'm like ready to pick up the phone and buy this stuff back and you know there's a little devil there and then the angel and she's saying don't do it and he's saying buy it and i pick up the phone and i buy them i might have missed the top of the dot-com bubble by an hour i ended up losing three billion dollars unable to accept his failure druckenmiller quit quantum fund and goes back to solely managing his own ducang fund [Music] i had quit quantum and duquesne was down 15 and i had given up on the year and i went away for four months and i didn't see a financial newspaper i didn't say anything so i come back and to my astonishment the nasdaq has rallied back almost to the high turkey miller immediately realizes that this is a chance to recover his previous losses when the price of oil has gone up the dollar has gone way up and it's gone up since i was on my sabbatical and i knew that normally this particular cocktail had always been negative for earnings in the us economy so i started buying very large positions in two and five-year us treasuries so i keep buying these treasuries and greenspan keeps giving these hawkish speeches and they have a bias to titan and i'm almost getting angry and every time he gives a speech i keep buying more and more and more and that turned out to be one of the best bets i remain and again there was no price movement i just had such a fundamental belief so sometimes it's price sometimes it's just such a belief in the fundamentals in 2008 his fund achieves a positive return while the rest of the market is gutted but he comes to realize that it is getting more difficult to maintain his performance by 2010 the world has changed beyond recognition never in history have the world economies being so interconnected drucker miller decides to return his investors money and stops trying to live up to his past performance well let's be clear i'm not making 30 a year anymore since i retired and i'm not running the size i used to and i do feel like i left so much on the table however since his retirement the market has entered into an unprecedented boom the structure of the market has evolved even further and retail investors once again are flooding the market there just there have been a number of instances over my career where it was very clear to me that the world had changed the world changed on 9 11. the world changed when the wall came down in germany the world changed the night donald trump was elected and these set in place usually two to four year trends of concentric circles you can play and i've always felt comfortable again i'm not the man i used to be of jumping in big with a thesis and if it's working staying with it thanks again to daily upside for sponsoring this video if you haven't subscribed already click the link in the bio to receive their weekday and weekend edition absolutely free [Music] you"

    "content": "[Music] watch excuse me the government raises interest rates twice in one day to 15 in its all-out battle to prop up sterling but after a frantic days trading the pound plunges again today has been an extremely difficult and turbulent day george soros made a billion dollars almost overnight this is the infamous black wednesday of 1992. losing 3.5 billions the bank of england is in defeat at the hands of george soros what's it like to have a lot of money it gives you a degree of freedom and it also gives you a degree of power we all need to wake up to who george soros is and how big his organization is a major takedown of george soros is in process george soros is one of the richest men in the world he would be blamed for the financial collapses in thailand malaysia indonesia japan and russia [Music] please [Music] george soros childhood is anything but normal his father tevadar soros was a prisoner of war during world war one and spent three years on the run in siberia by the time his second son george soros was born in 1930 his built a successful career as a lawyer in budapest well he was a prisoner of war in russia and he escaped and he lived through the russian revolution and he came back from that a changed man tivorar spent a great deal of time teaching george about the art of survival i mean he went through a horrendous experience and that taught him a lesson which then came in very useful he in turn taught me a lesson which came in useful to me his father's pragmatism and survival instinct will be the building blocks for success later in life but the peace and prosperity his family enjoys is short-lived [Music] [Applause] [Music] i think hitler is uniquely the most genocidally evil dictator that there ever was and fundamentally he was gonna kill as many people who were outside of his master race principle as he possibly could and he did hitler's conquest had wiped out millions of jews in western europe his next target is hungary a country housing the largest jewish population in eastern europe nazi authorities start distributing deportation notice to local jews but such a deportation notice is a death sentence in disguise the young george soros is asked by the nazi authorities to deliver the notice to the jewish community having suffered the worst of war soros father is determined to survive again by any means necessary basically that there are times when the normal rules don't apply you see the way you've looked at the world it's just not applicable because the world has changed so he sold his real estate holdings and starts hiding his family in different locations around the country under false identities and by bribing authorities by the time nazis retreated from hungary all the jewish children of soros age are severely traumatized some even bring handguns to the classrooms but not george soros he finds the whole experience of the war during 1944 throatling it's obvious now that sorrows may have a different personality than most people like him thrive by taking huge risks and is a common characteristic of many great traitors but soros happiness is only temporary after one evil is defeated a worse one has taken its place [Music] the occupation by russians will forever scar soros family suddenly two russian soldiers stepped in front of us and they led me down the one step in front of my head with his weapon they raped me two of them and that's how it happened after that sorrows is never the same he's deeply troubled and starts questioning the nature of reality you're going to see very likely the um many of the patterns you'd seen ongoing see ptsd that they'll be emotional numbing that there'll be a fear and a confusion about close relationships it's not unusual to see dissociative symptoms and dissociation is when a person almost breaks away it's as though they break away from their own reality or break away from themselves is they're not almost they're not present in the situation anymore they've gone someplace else the young george is desperately trying to break away from this unforgiving chaos of life after his 17th birthday he leaves his family behind and embarks on a journey to the west by the time soros arrives in london he is penniless to make ends meet he becomes a waiter and saves money by eating leftovers from customers after all the suffering sorrows has endured there is a light at the end of the tunnel he's accepted to the london school of economics london school of economics is perhaps the best school to study economics but what really made this school special was the amount of world leaders it has created but initially sorrows is a loner thrown into the world of unknowns the only thing that he can do is to devote all of his time to his coursework he study under the famous philosopher carl popper so i think popper was was a genuine contribution to our understanding of what we're doing his problem was to discriminate between einstein on the one hand and marx and freud on the other as far as he was concerned marx and freud were sort of pseudoscience and einstein was real science but the question is what was the difference and it was his notion of the concept of falsifiability sorrows finds popper's ideas intriguing i was very much influenced by karl popper who taught me that that perfect knowledge is not attainable we all act on the basis of an imperfect understanding of reality while before sorrows was aimless now he finds his mission in life becoming a philosopher just like his mentor carl popper the soros quickly finds out that there is no way he can afford a graduate school the shorter money money was very serious it was very important for me to make a living i developed my philosophy in college while i was also earning my way through college by working in various jobs for instance i had the waiter in a nightclub while i was studying during the day he needs to make a living fast upon graduation he senses there's a good money to be made in finance he was really taking the initiatives he wrote a letter to every managing director of every bank in london hoping to find a job it worked a merchant bank offers him a job as a trainee he happily accepts it he works as a trader specializing in gold stock arbitrage trying to take advantage of the price discrepancies in different markets but he's a terrible at the job in just two years he quits after world war ii the u.s emerged as the most powerful nation on the planet the economy overall grew by 37 percent during the 1950s thanks to eisenhower's administration inflation was low and so was the unemployment rate people around the world are eager to come here to pursue their american dream sorrows is one of them in 1956 he moved to new york city working as an arbitrary trader for several financial firms i had a very modest ambition i just wanted to five years in america and earn at the time i said a hundred thousand dollars and then i could live on the on the income from that american industry has grown with prodigious speed to its immense size of today and the capital to build the nation from a raw frontier to the greatest industrial giant in the world but he struggles to find an edge in the industry the job of arbitrary trader makes startups think about how different assets relate to each other at the time very few investors thought about world finance as a interconnected system but soros was one of the first to have that sort of system view sorrows is going to find a new approach to investing although he was educated as an economist he finds classical economic ideas not useful at all in the real world my interpretation of financial markets directly contradicts the efficient market hypothesis which has been the prevailing theory about financial markets that theory claims that markets tend towards equilibrium deviations occur in a random fashion and can be attributed to extraneous shocks if that theory is valid mine is false and vice versa instead soros finds out that the real world of finance resembles that of a chaotic system almost any human enterprise is inevitably driven by two forces reality and the expectation by the participants they are interdependent but since human perception are biased and flawed there will always be a gap such a gap represents trading opportunities soros probably didn't know at the time his theory of reflexivity resembles that of a chaos theory without a doubt chaos is the natural state of affairs of human beings if i'm afraid of um being mugged in new york city walking down the street i will become very very cautious as i become cautious i become a target therefore i am inviting the very thing that i'm afraid of soros believes that our reality is more dynamic and chaotic than what people believes their biased perception of reality will cause them to behave irrationally creating an opportunity for him to exploit sorrow's insight puts him 10 steps ahead of everyone else on wall street by 1969 he has saved 250 thousand dollars for himself as a trader but to test his theory he needs a larger sum of money that is not a small amount for someone living in the 1960s but still not enough to start his fund but over the years as a trader soros has built a strong relationship with many wealthy european investors they put up six million dollars into soros funds he has a simple investing proposition looking for a reflected boom bust trend riding it on the way up and shorting it on the way down his timing couldn't be more perfect in 1969 real estate investment trust was a new hot investment vehicle reits have proven themselves to be an attractive method by which investors can own commercial real estate soros recognizes that this new asset class will likely experience a boom bust cycle he predicts that it will crash in three years but before it actually happens it will keep going up to write this trend he started heavily buying reits sorrow's a speculator he buys these real estate trusts not because he likes properties but simply because he sees an opportunity to cash in charles is right he makes one million dollars on the way up but he makes even more money by shorting them when his predictions come true three years later soros hedge fund nearly doubles every year managing 50 million dollars by 1973. one of the shocking traits of soros investment style is that he doesn't bet as often as a day trader but when he does make a bet it's usually very large sometimes risking his entire portfolio but his phone soon grows larger than what what man can handle he needs to find a partner someone who can operate at his level jim rogers seems like the most unlikely partner for george soros raised in demopolis alabama jim rogers grew up during a bumpy time in the american south a brilliant student jim rogers spent his college years in oxford studying politics economics and philosophy like soros rogers has more of a global view of the financial market meaning that he thinks about the world markets as a interconnected system with each element affecting the other this very much resembles soros thinking now what does this mean for you your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today after nixon broke the u.s tradition by attaching u.s dollars to gold the financial market is never the same and by 1971 it was clear the dollar could no longer be exchanged into gold and that began the modern age of inflation by 1972 soros and rogers sensed that there will be a structural change in the banking industry that no one has caught on banking industry before the 1980s was very regulated and it wasn't very cool to become a banker the beginning of the 1970s the american banking system was still frozen into immobility the industry was highly fragmented and regimented adult business attracted dull people who were more concerned with job security than with profits bank shares were traded by appointment but i detected some signs of life with easy money flowing into the market soros realizes that a banking sector is set to boom he instructs his trader to buy as many shares as possible in major banks generating 50 profit in less than a year some banks were poised to embark on balanced growth by equity leveraging i.e selling shares at the premium the bouquet of shares of bank shares i recommended did in fact rise by some 50 percent in that year while the 70s has been a difficult period for america soros made more money than anyone in finance he's truly the pioneer in macro investing in 1970s he invests in japanese dutch and french stocks and at some point he put one third of his portfolio in japanese stocks which doubled in a year in the first decade of his fund it went up three thousand percent an unparalleled feat on wall street by 1980 soros fund has 381 million dollars under management he renamed his phone to quantum fund reflecting the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics as a child sorrows fantasize about being a god i did have juvenile fantasies of saving the world so i had that the sort of what i called messianic fantasies which i think most adolescents have i've been somewhat more successful of actually acting out those fantasies to sorrows his track record shows that he may indeed be special he's able to see how the world works better than anyone but the market is about to humble his oversized ego the 1970s will forever be known as the decade of soaring inflation the fed tried to intervene in 1973 by raising interest rates but it created a mass unemployment by the beginning of 1979 inflation jumped 8 from the year before at the same time the us dollar is losing its value fast finally fat chairman paul volcker decides that inflation must come down even at a cost of creating unemployment you know you can't deal with that problem by simply saying we're going to let inflation go ahead while most investors see hyperinflation as a bad thing but sorrows sees it as an opportunity similarly right now in u.s inflation has gotten to a 32-year high but most people don't know about one asset class that has performed well during hyperinflation throughout history it is contemporary arts contemporary art prices appreciated by 23.2 percent versus 3.8 percent for the s p 500 during periods of 3 inflation or higher which is right now most people see contemporary art as something nice to hang on the wall but billionaires like soros see them as a great place to store and grow wealth why it is because contemporary art has outpaced sap 500 from 1995 to 2020. for example if you look at the rockefellers they'll mask more art collections than anyone right now you can become art investors like soros larry fink and me with a new app called masterworks dot io masterworks allows anyone to invest in multi-million dollar paintings by famous artists like warhol banksy and picasso just like picking stocks online and they recently raised 110 million dollars in sears a funding at a valuation over one billion dollars so you know that this market has a ton of potential this is how it works masterworks will buy physical painting securitize it with scc and issue shares representing an investment on their app that way you know that it is an sec approved investment and it is safe the securitization process also let you invest in paintings by picasso and banksy for a fraction of the original cost instead of spending millions of dollars you can either hold your shares until masterwork sells the painting or sell to other masterworks members on their platform once they sell the painting they will give you your share of the profit for example masterworks investors saw 32 percent analyze appreciation from the sale of their banks in painting now the fees which almost doubled the return of s p 500 and in 2021 investors are set to receive a 31 annualized appreciation for the sale of their george condo painting i'm a proud investor in basquiat on masterworks platform and i invite you to join me with me through the link in the description my viewers can skip the waitlist and invest alongside me and other billionaires in a few clicks sorrows is certain that pope volcker's action will spell doom to the u.s economy the way the fed increases interest rate is by selling the chartered bills at the market sometimes at a lower price thus the interest rate will increase sorrows is expecting an inverted yield curve to happen the inverted yield curve happens when there's a stronger demand for long-term bonds versus short-term bonds and stocks that's exactly what soros expects to happen so he goes long on long-term bonds and sells short of stocks and short-term bonds but his timing is wrong the economy however remains strong far longer than he anticipated when sorrow's prediction doesn't happen in time his phone loses 80 million dollars in 1980. this is his first major loss i think it hurt him deeply and also teach him a lesson about the business of running a hedge fund after losing 22 percent in 1980 half his investors cashed out as an expert in boom and bust he realizes that this may be the end for him and it's time to retire due to a disappointing year in 1980 george soros emma retires and marries his second wife the 28 year old susan weber he left quantum fund at the hands of his replacement jm markets jeep marcus was a 33 year old mutual fund manager who made 69 percent return in 1982. charles fund has a massive comeback in 1982 generating 56.9 percent he believes that marcus will continue this track record in the years to come [Music] while in 1983 quantum phone was up 25 percent he only achieved a 9 gang the year later to sorrows and his investors it is a big embarrassment he now believes perhaps no one can be as good as he is by the end of 1984 he comes back after three years of retirement the highest order of business before the nation is to restore our economic prosperity reagan's principles were number one lower marginal tax rates number two deregulate number three hold down government spending number four follow a monetary policy that will bring you low and low inflation the way reagan wanted to keep a low inflation is by having a strong dollar that means the u.s can import cheaper goods thus the price level will decrease but sorrows has a different idea in the wake of reagan's high spending note taxing policies from the early 1980s the united states soros believes is heading for depression by 1985 soros has come back from his retirement he sees reagan's policy on keeping a strong dollar a disaster for america but also a great opportunity for him to cash in he goes long on the japanese yen and deutschmark while shorting us dollar and crew oil his prediction starts to materialize on september 22nd 1985. the central banks around the world start pushing the dollar down by late october the dollar falls 13 against yen and a year later 25 percent altogether sorrows made 150 million dollars profits a shocking 122 percent return to make profits in currencies soros had to borrow a lot of money sometimes using 10 times leverage the danger is that if the market goes against him it can literally destroy him after making large profits in 1986 soros believes that his doomsday prediction is temporarily delayed so he goes on a buying spree of u.s equities hoping to catch one last ride before it crashes but his timing is wrong again the dow could not be saved even by falling long and short-term interest rates and closed with a lost guest sky of 300 points at 1950.76 the black-mounted crash caught sorrows by surprise he's trapped in a liquidity squeeze the predator is now a prey when sorrows was dumping his asses in the market all the traitors sensed that a big whale was in trouble so everyone just waited [Music] so sorrows was able to sell his smp futures at a price level of 1.95 but when the market closes it goes right back to 240. so he was clearly taken advantage by wall street traders [Music] in fact the crash wiped out sorrow's entire profit for 1987. sorrows was right about the crash but was dead wrong about the sequence of events that happened after taking a loss in october sorrow's other investment came into fruition generating a 14 overall return for that year the 1987 crash makes sorrows once again want to retire so then about 15 years let's say later i started thinking why should i keep kill myself making money sorrow's investment strategy is very nerve-wracking to say the least and as people grow older the risk-taking tendency tends to decrease i was walking on the street from one bank to another trying to make the arrangement and i thought i was going to have a heart attack and that's when i realized this tension to make money is really not worth it if it's going to kill me that's when i decided to actually change course when i decided to actually return to philanthropy without audacious risk taking soros knows his phone's performance will suffer to retire in peace and to maintain the fund's performance sorrow needs to find a younger version of himself to take his place by the fall of 1988 he found his man like sorrows stanley druckenmiller has a humble beginning he grew up in a single parent family he didn't go to any fancy ivy league college and in fact to make money he had to open a hot dog stand on campus darken miller's career takes off immediately after graduation by 1988 his strategic aggressive investing fund becomes the highest performing fund in the industry drunken miller was admired of sorrows long before they met they're very similar in a lot of ways both have a big disregard for academic finance and they're all big picture thinkers and are also very practical after spending one year mentoring druckenmiller charles finally given the full reign of quantum fund up until that point i had a very good record but it was only after i was with george that i learned how much you should really press a bet when your confidence level is extremely high i did find where before i was there don't get me wrong but but it was amazing to watch that man when we had something we really believed in to see the way he would he would size risk and reward [Music] after retirement soros starts spending most of his time with his charity i started out with a framework that i really developed as a student when i was influenced by karl popper open society and his enemies and i set up a foundation to foster the open societies the fund's performance has actually gotten better after he left so people speculate that soros uses a charity to get access to world leaders in order to have a better information about the world economy but really the stellar returns of quantum fund after 1990 is all because of one man dragon miller [Music] [Music] you"

because they were going to all be away for two weeks i wasn't happy but i wasn't sad it was just like whoa this hasn't happened to me before i wasn't even thinking about work and and i got the message loud and clear you have to take all of the technologies that have disrupted other industries and start to disrupt your own and focus on the new creation [Music] in a world dominated by men kathy wood became the symbol for a new generation of investors they challenge the establishment by forging their own path [Music] philia los angeles is on the rise to become the second biggest city in america people are moving to l.a at a rate of 3 000 a month kathy woods parents are one of them they immigrated to la during the booming 50s from ireland [Music] wood's father serves in the u.s air force as a radar engineer i think from an early age kathy really admires her father who pushes her to think like engineer due to the constant change of deployment locations kathy's family regularly moves around the united states this really exposes her to different ideas different people and also makes it very adaptive to change kathy wood graduated top of her high school and was accepted by the university of california having been born the child of immigrants in the united states i was very fearful as i went into college that you know i was the oldest and i had to carry the mantle for the family and so i approached it with a great bit of trepidation like most of the middle-class families in the rough 70s woods family struggled financially a statewide jobless rate of 9.3 percent has jammed local unemployment officers in terms of people some 920 000 californians are now out of work she has to work part-time to pay for her tuition and like her father kathy aspires to pursue a career in science or technology but he advised against it as he believes that his daughter will be better off being a business woman then wood decides to pursue economics and finance hoping one day to provide her family with more financial support even as a young woman she realizes that it will be her responsibility to take care of a family one day because she is the oldest child and also a devout christian in college she studied under the acclaimed economist arthur laffer laffer was famous for his theory on maximizing tax revenue there are two tax rates to give the same amount of revenue there's a high tax rate and a low tax rate no country should ever want to be in that high tax rate range i mean why would you ever want a tax at this point where if you lowered tax rates you collected more money and you have more output employment and production so this is the laffer curve which really brings together the debate about taxes he was my mentor at usc university of southern california and he's a very well-known economist austrian school um you know he's been a wonderful mentor leffer's teaching left a big impact on her which is why to this day she's a big proponent that tax cuts will benefit innovation which in turn will create economic growth intelligent and hard working kathy wood becomes the top student in her school laffer sees the immense potential in this unassuming girl and finds her a lucrative job after graduation kathy became the assistant economist for capital group one of the largest investment companies in the early 1980s with assets over tens of billions of dollars kathy wood's career is taking off but then after three years she is scooped up by another investment company in new york as chief economist she is just barely 25. jennison associates was a young investment company at the time as their chief economist kathy wood is facing the us economy at a tipping point i have directed secretary connelly to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interest of the united states the 70s were among the worst decades for the us economy and by the time the 70s ended it was a total mess prices went up infamously during the carter presidency inflation was increasing and unemployment was increasing at the same time that wasn't supposed to happen inflation hits everybody unemployment even at its worst hits only about 10 percent of the population at any one time and so the public shifted its concern from unemployment to inflation in a massive way by 1980 all of that was about to change i want to work in washington to roll back the crushing burden of taxation that limits investment production and the generation of real wealth for our people a job and savings and hope for our children is part of that dream at that time reagan's economic policy wasn't really tested and the market was very wary of it and many people believe that rigging will collapse the economy for good but kathy wood thinks otherwise as an investment firm jennyson regularly invites economists to lecture their employees about inflation and interest rates we must put into place rules for financial behavior for private sector nicknamed dr doom henry kaufman was the chief economist at solomon brothers critical of the reagan administration henry kaufman warned in 1981 that the president's economic policies would drive interest rates and the dollar sky high do we economists know anything and it was a very legitimate question because if you don't know enough to capture the most extraordinary event economic event in all of our lifetimes what in the world do we really know for the first few years reagan's economic policy didn't seem to work and it was very popular to criticize him and someone even tried to kill him so a lot of people supported kaufman's claims except kathy wood after a thorough analysis of her data she finds evidence contradicting kaufman's claim doctors doom and gloom no doctor's doom and death right yeah yeah yes and so and that's where i learned about you know wow if everyone is going in that direction and back then it was inflation and interest rates are embedded in the system at a double-digit rate this is the early 80s right and and someone dares to go the opposite way after those who had gone the opposite way had been bludgeoned wood challenges him by arguing that interest rates have peaked and may even go down but being a young woman in finance in the early 80s she was easily dismissed it's obvious that kathy wood was a constant underdog even from the very beginning [Music] by october 1982 inflation has fallen to five percent and long-run interest rates began to decline the fed allowed the federal funds rate to fall back to nine percent we've been really really busy we were swamped the beginning of the week and it's just business has been great all the way along as america rises from the 70s economic slump kathy wood's career is reaching a new height she rises through the ranks soon becoming the managing director for jennison by 1998 after 18 years at jennison kathy wood has built a career that others can only dream of [Music] she accomplishes that while also raising three children it was the height of the dotcom bubble kathy had witnessed the incredible rise of many tech companies and there's a sense that she wants to strike out on her own in the 1990s the booming economy led to the rise of a new type of investment funds the hedge funds due to their unique setup hedge funds allowed their managers to make billions of personal fortune i would argue that probably most of them do not make money but a handful of them make a tremendous amount of money and they have made the founders of the hedge funds extremely wealthy and partly this is because they charge very hefty fees much higher fees than you would pay to vanguard or you know any of your mutual fund companies while kathy is contemplating her next moves one of her colleagues is already thinking of starting her own hedge fund lulu wang is a highly profitable hedge fund manager that no one knows about she is quite mysterious no one knows her fund's performance but she regularly makes 50 million donations and she's on the board of many big companies like metlife so one can assume that her phone's doing pretty well but lulu wang started from a modest place after college wang became a housewife but she quickly became tired of it and decided to pursue an mba from colombia similar to wood wang climbed through the ranks of jenison associates and became their executive vice president managing over 4 billion dollars of assets but that is not enough by 1998 after witnessing the rise of hedge funds and the unthinkable fortunes they amassed wang wanted to start her own fund to do that she needs to find a partner who is just as capable as her kathy wood by 1998 kathy wood and wang started their own hedge fund tupelo capital management well on their way to making a killing in the market it was right before the dot-com bubble as the new year begins an estimated two and a half million computers will be on the network serving as many as 20 million people during a bulk market capital is much easier to acquire by 2000 her fund garnered 800 million dollars of assets the largest female-led hedge fund at the time but it soon became obvious to kathy a hedge fund was not her true calling and sure hedge funds have been so lucrative for asset managers but if you see everyone moving into hedge funds and private and you look at a new rapper that's actually a good deal for the end investor and you go with low cost and public using the private market valuations as an umbrella maybe just maybe you'll be on to something big her passion is at picking stocks of companies with world-changing potential ones that are undervalued by wall street [Music] by the 1990s the tech revolution is ushering america into a new age interest rates declined providing the necessary capital for innovative companies [Music] at the same time clinton's administration lowered the marginal capital gains tax creating an unprecedented flow of money to the stock market and because those interest rates are down business investment and equipment is growing at seven times the rate of the previous four years auto sales are way up home sales at a record high millions of americans have refinanced their homes and our economy has produced 1.6 million private sector jobs in 1993 more than were created in the previous four years combined between 1995 and its peak in march 2000 the nasdaq composite stock market index rose 400 percent kathy wood joined wall street in 1980 in 20 years she built an enviable career in finance making her a highly sought after money manager but just three years after starting her own hedge fund kathy wood quit and joined a mutual fund company alliance bernstein after the dot-com crisis she sees a disconnect with the vc funding versus the public funding i felt that it was a huge unmet need in the market because after the tekken telecom bust and then 0809 so over those 10 years and and even longer we saw risk aversion rise in the market and what did that mean it meant to move towards indexed or passive strategies we saw a companies in the private markets trading for 10 or 20 or 30 times the valuations at this point kathy wood started developing her thesis on the exponential growth of innovative companies at bernstein wood was given 5 billion dollars to manage she looks at places no one sees investing with strong conviction in high-growth smaller cap stocks before 2006 woods fund outperformed the indexes virtually every year but her portfolio is volatile for her investors to stomach i did manage five billion dollars at alliance bernstein uh prior to launching arc and we were very thematic in our orientation we were a bit of an odd duck within that organization a portfolio occurs extremely volatile during a liquidity crisis although it is rare it still happens bear stearns was forced to take an emergency loan funded by all of us taxpayer bailout prompted investors to dump bear stearns stock the housing crisis of 2008 was one of the most severe liquidity crises as companies come under pressure as they lose their short-term funding they begin to dump assets and that in turn created pressure on the stock market which dropped very sharply and other asset prices came down as banks and trust companies trying to raise liquidity were dumping assets on the market because her investments are in smaller growth stocks their price tends to be more volatile and during a liquidity squeeze they tend to fall harder than others due to the smaller number of buyers in the market as a result kathy woods fund fell harder than the s p 500 in 2008. people do they react too much to short-term things in in the stock market whereas they behave quite rashly when they get into other investments if you've got a farm that's producing for you if you've got an apartment houses fully occupied why in the world would you sell it today because of what's happening in ukraine kathy wood believes her stocks will eventually recover but it does little to promote the confidence of her investors and some start withdrawing money she managed a mutual fund which is unlike a public company investors can actually withdraw their money from the fund worrying about losing clients executives at bernstein asked kathy to buy some index funds in her portfolio because portfolio managers and analysts they run back to what they think is safety they tend to run back diversify their portfolios get them closer to benchmarks our stocks are disproportionately punished in the early early stages of a correction owning index funds reduces the volatility of her fund but also her performance by 2014 it becomes more inevitable that she has to go at 54 kathy wood has made more money than 99.9 of americans enough to retire for life all the 20 year olds are jumping into this game and meanwhile all the 40 year olds and 50 year olds are more likely to win it because they have context a woman of deep faith wood realizes that she must continue to serve god by bringing about the future that god wanted this time she is determined to answer to no one except god himself in the financial industry and um after the tech and telecom bust and then even more so after 0.809 i began to see just incredible risk aversion career risk business risk and everybody was worshiping uh the almighty index benchmarks and that was not consistent with what we were doing at all so we were becoming i i describe it as an otter and otter duck [Music] kathy wood dreams about building a new type of etfs that don't yet exist in the market cathy wood is definitely an idealistic woman whose confidence is very contagious if you think about it what's a stock price if it's not a symbol of confidence she has this confidence because she believes that she is divinely inspired while it is inspiring to dream kathy's faith is about to be tested many other people thought we were going to fail but i just didn't believe that and one of the reasons people thought we were going to fail is here we chose a rapper that was dominated by passive portfolios right and put an active strategy in there and people thought that was crazy while kathy wood has done thorough research on her investment ideas her fund sees virtually no tractions after two and a half years of no traction effectively i began to say wow was that a bad was that a bad move without enough capital she struggles to bring her dream into reality that changes when an unexpected investor comes calling bill huang flew a little too close to the sun by taking on an insatiable amount of risk before his catastrophic blow up huang was at the top of the hedge fund game huang was the protege to the famous investor julian robertson who gave huang 25 million dollars to start his hedge fund in 2000 in less than 20 years huang built his hedge fund to have 30 billion dollars of assets you know we see what god is how god is leading the whole world you know and and human race to through these companies as a devout christian himself huang sees kathy wood to be someone he can lift up and also as someone that will make him even wealthier he decides to provide the seed money to all of her etfs [Music] huang's funding gave kathy wood a boost of confidence but to actually succeed she will need to find a way to stand out after the housing crisis of 2008 people's confidence in active management has nearly vanished as you know indexing has continued to perform really well against the broad base of active managers what i would say is high cost active management is essentially debt as a practice by 2019 index funds have more assets than all the active funds but imagine a world where everyone is putting money passively in everything how will our financial system even function kathy wood thinks she can do better [Music] so our analysts they have domain expertise for the most part in the new new world one foot in the new world why because they've just been educated uh in crisper gene editing and have experimented it with it themselves or they've worked in the industry not only that wood capitalizes on the rise of social media like twitter and reddit wood realizes she could do what github did to software by making her research openly available in the investment world a lot of font managers like to pretend to be sophisticated often hiding their so-called proprietary research it's because they don't want you to see through them by 2018 she was still rather unknown in the investment world but that is about to change gotta start with tesla because for months now you have said this is a four thousand dollar stock given all the drama over the last few weeks do you still think that yes that is a one thousand one hundred percent increase from its price at the time at the time tesla struggled to produce enough model threes tesla's ceo elon musk even sleeps in the factory trying to solve the production issue kathy wood's optimistic forecast of tesla's future is widely ridiculed by 2021 tesla has surpassed her price target two years ahead of her forecast while she was dismissed by the establishment in 2019 there is one group of investors taking notice of kathy wood the apes by 2019 there are nearly 5 billion people online on reddit alone there are 430 million users since the financial crisis people have grown more and more distrustful of wall street it's just that the investment banking provision will sell as long as it can be sold on reddit many retail investors start gathering to share research and make investments countering that of wall street by 2019 the movement is still small lacking funds and momentum but a historical event will forever change that [Music] we saw our third trading halt in just six sessions right at the open a 15-minute halt with the s p down seven percent as president trump said coronavirus may be an issue through july or august [Music] a quorum is present the motion is adopted [Applause] covert 19 was a pivotal moment in the american economy all of a sudden you have trillions of newly printed cash injected into the system many trading platforms immediately capitalized on this change we're focused on building an awesome user experience onboarding something like 150 000 customers in such a short period of time is pretty much unprecedented in the brokerage industry a few thousand dollars wealthier the apes of the reddit community finally have the resources to take on wall street you're witnessing the french revolution of finance where the proletariat is rising up to change the order structure in finance and they're able to do that because they have costless data they have costless trading as a woman who is often underestimated by wall street kathy wood becomes the icon of the retail investors the world is changing since 2008 america has enjoyed over 10 years of a bull market driven by innovation the finance industry is undergoing a drastic shift kathy wood is the face of this change driven by relentless passion kathy wood turned a middle-class upbringing into her own empire for the past three years many of her predictions have come true or are coming true but her strategy is still volatile and the market remains to be unforgiving as arc investors are about to find out it's a new piece from barron's highlighting that investors have pulled a net 2.7 billion dollars from the funds since the end of june by the beginning of 2021 arc had a 14 drop to date a 14 drop in market value is not something that a index fund investor can tolerate but not the disciples of kathy wood and here we are we are a volatile strategy and our our our response was well volatility on the upside is not a bad thing right it took a lot to get people's attention because they thought we were too risky too crazy and i see now it's coming full circle because i hear that again but um it's much less risky than we believe the benchmarks are the benchmarks are filling up with value traps because the innovation platforms there are five of them and they involve 14 different technologies that are all taking off right now they are going to disrupt and disintermediate the traditional world order so i think the big risk is in the benchmarks not what we're doing but it is a mistake to dismiss her as some lucky stock picker for one she has that quality of a disciplined portfolio manager although kathy wood has strong faith in tesla she doesn't allow it to be more than 10 of her portfolio but when a stock gets to 11 or 12 in the portfolio it means that that means it has appreciated by 10 to 20 relative to the other positions in the portfolio and usually what we're doing is being opportunistic and taking advantage of a a drop in a stock kathy is not hesitant to exit a position when the fundamentals of the business change today kathy what remains to be a controversial figure unlike her days at bernstein kathy wood may have finally found a business model that works for her and a group of extremely loyal followers that will stick with her for the long am you"

    "content": "[Music] it was the year before the black monday crash wall street darling larry fink suffered a hundred million trading laws i was so angry at myself i was just mortified in myself humiliated fake now is forced to leave the company but upon his failure he will build the mightiest company in the world blackrock [Music] another too big to fail asset manager which handles over seven trillion dollars in direct management and another 20 trillion through their proprietary software i mean larry fit with those numbers you can say whatever he wants blackrock was fantastic [Music] california is on the rise to become the most populated state in america like the rest of the country the 60s was a turbulent time for california a decade of a drastic political change it was such an exciting heady time to find out that under the official reality there was this seething turmoil of young people learning new music new thoughts new ideas new literature new poetry new ways of being larry fink is one of those young people he enrolls in ucla to pursue a political science degree hoping one day to make impact as a politician after getting an mba degree from usa la fink takes a job at a leading investment bank first boston as a bond trader it was a perfect time to get into the bond business in the early 70s bonds only began to be actively traded larry finn excels at this job he rapidly rises through the ranks becoming the youngest manager at his department i started first boss in 1976 i was the first freddie mac bond trader and so the mortgage market was just if it's infancy and then in 1982 we had the ability to put a pc on our trading desk before that you had no ability to put a computer on the trading desk and it was very clear to me that if we could have computing power on the trading desk we were going to have the ability to dissect cash flows of mortgages and we were the most profitable component of first boston in 83 and 84 and 85. by 1983 the american economy had rebound from a decathlon recession the highest order of business before the nation is to restore our economic prosperity after taking over the presidency reagan worked to boost the economy he starts cutting taxes and deregulating wall street creating a perfect environment for financial innovations one of such is the mortgage-backed securities simply put they bundle millions of mortgages and turn them into securities that can be traded by any investor larry fink was one of the architects behind this financial innovation which 20 years later morphed into economic bomb but in the meantime larry sells these newly minted securities to large investors like pension funds and endowments generating tens of millions of fees for first boston at the time first boston was at the top of the investment banking industry specializing in mergers and acquisitions after creating one billion dollar profit for the firm larry fing becomes the most profitable man at first boston when you're at that level and you've had all of that success and you have all of this money there's a mindset that you're almost invincible but then he loses 100 million dollars in just one quarter of 1986. so you could work a lifetime creating wealth under certain assumptions that something can't happen and then bang your everything you've lost everything for your whole lifetime because you thought it couldn't happen that is a year before the infamous black monday crash and the market was still in a euphoric state because everyone was making money unless you're head for events like black monday whatever alpha you you think you're gonna get you're not gonna get it when you started having those types of successes the firm gave you more capital we were taking bigger and bigger risks without the intended risk technology to navigate that risk and in the second quarter of 1986 we lost 100 million dollars wall street one big loser can raise all your winners the same is true for reputation although he wasn't fired but he was sidelined all of a sudden people don't want to be seen with him anymore he becomes the untouchable the message is clear it is time to quit the trouble is with tarnish reputation no investment bank will want to hire him at age 36 larry fink is unemployed i said to myself 30 days after we lost money in that quarter even though we had we made 130 the first quarter and lost 100 of it in the second quarter i said i'm leaving but it took me a year and a half because i never ever thought i was going to leave but it took me a year and a half to try to determine what i wanted to do next always a competitive man think refuses to surrender and is determined to regain his past glory by any means necessary this time he will start his own business and to do that he will need investors but with his reputation it is nearly impossible to raise money until he meets the legendary steve schwarzman [Music] steve schwartzman the founder of blackstone is one of the most powerful figures on wall street in his 30 years rang he turned blackstone into the biggest private equity company in the world but by 1988 blackstone was still a lesser known consulting firm and like think steve schwartzman was a cast away he was a rising star in lehman brothers on his way to become the ceo but due to a nasty power struggle he was forced to leave the company i saw a lot of behavior that i didn't like and so decided to go out and do something with my partner who'd been thrown out the year before by the management that went in and ultimately blew up the company in 1988 blackstone just started as a private equity business and barely completed his first deal but steve schwartzman is already thinking big by expanding the company to more areas and he is considering a wealth management business one reason why schwarzman was so successful is that he has an eye for talent he knows how to hire the best people we wanted to attract somebody to run it who was a 10 on a scale of 10 because you'll find in your careers if you're a 10 god bless you you'll be wildly successful if you attract tens they always make it rain if you need rain and they just have an ability to sense problems design solutions do new things and that's what a 10 does and larry fink is a 10. after meeting fink schwarzman decided to start a joint venture called blackstone financial management by investing five million dollars with fink it took me a year and a half to assemble my thoughts and and i told it i told the story to steve shorts and pete peterson and they loved it and they they had more confidence in me than i had myself they wanted to go right ahead and we did that and it all you know we started making it we actually started making money within two weeks we talk about investment company and a fund is easy to get confused in this case steve schwartzman gave 5 million dollars to start a management company but then they have to raise money for their fund within five years think build has fun to have eight billion dollars under management fink has learned a lesson that one should always be risk conscious one of his investment principles is that he will not put down a dime until the risk can be understood and calculated there were so many other companies that really didn't understand the risk and most importantly the buy side the investors had no idea the risk they were taking and there was a great need for a company that starts off with a high concentration and risk analytics and and principally in the fixed income area then there was a lot of analytics and equities back then but nothing in in bonds he was one of the first in the industry to rely heavily on statistics and algorithms to make investment decisions fink is now back on the top he recognizes that in order to grow bigger his company needs to offer more stock options to attract talented people he demands schwarzman to give up some of blackstone's ownership to the great disappointment steve schwartzman rejected his plan both steve schwartzman and larry fink are highly competitive taipei people but steve schrussman is a investment banker while fink is more of a trader steve schwartzman he's unusually conservative actually unusually risk-averse for a successful entrepreneur investor this was a visceral thing like a primal impulse not to lose money [Music] two alphas are always doomed to clash from the get-go after being rejected by steve schwartzman for his proposal fink is determined to completely sever ties with the firm by finding a buyer to purchase blackstone's ownership as schwarzman is going through a divorce in his personal life the news that fink wants to lead blackstone sent him into a frenzy ego is a great thing in business an eagle you show me a titan of industry and i'll show you somebody with a big ego but on wall street everything has a price including ego [Music] is now even better because the rate on a pnc bank home equity line of credit [Music] just took a tumble pnc bank stands for pittsburgh national corporation a finance group with a long history and lineage in 1991 pnc was on a buying spree acquiring dozens of smaller firms it is a perfect buyer for fink to get rid of blackstone's control they offer hundreds of millions of dollars to buy out blackstone steak think about this steve schwartzman and fink started this business with just about 5 million dollars that is a huge return in just five years although steve schwartzman is still hesitant the money it just took good to ignore he agrees to sell the asset management business to pnc this is the biggest mistake in schwarzman's career at the time even he couldn't foresee that the side business of blackstone would someday become a financial giant that dwarfs even blackstone itself 1994 was a fateful year for blackrock after separating from blackstone the company was still small by wall street standard 8 billion a fixed income portfolio is not considered to be big because bonds tend to make less returns and a little bit less risky now free to build blackrock any way he likes fink is holding nothing back but to win he must find an edge that others don't have and it will come from an unexpected place remember our old kitchen [Music] under the leadership of jack welch je started an explosive growth fueled by easy money in the mid 80s general electric venture into new industries including news and finance the company bought kidder peabody a one's respected investment bank but was later found guilty of insider trading and accounting fraud once welch realizes how deeply in trouble his new firm is he decides to sell it to virtually anyone willing to buy pine weber another investment bank is willing to acquire peabody from je but not its toxic bond portfolio which consists of 10 billion dollars worth of cmos a type of mortgage securities these derivatives are notorious for the complexity welch was a brilliant manager but he was no finance expert he frantically tries to get rid of the toxic assets left by peabody but due to the complexity of the portfolio no wall street firm wants to touch it except blackrock as the pioneer of cmos fig realizes if blackrock can help ge properly evaluate the assets that he is set to make a huge profit and it will also be a breakout moment finx team of quantitative analysts works tirelessly for weeks to re-evaluate the portfolio and to repackage them into a new set of derivative assets blackrock helped ge gradually unload the assets and recover their value with minimal loss if you're confused about what he did and how he did it you're not alone it's called financial engineering it's about packaging restructuring existing securities into new ones while some of these securities are indeed valuable they are only available to big players in finance but in the early 1990s the financial engineering becomes larry fink's number one competitive edge for then on blackrock's developed a reputation as a ghostbuster for companies with a problematic assets larry fing becomes the guy to call the success with je solidifies blackrock's reputation on wall street just three years after separating from blackstone blackrock's asset under management grew to 46 billion dollars its parent company pnc decided to merge its wealth management division with blackrock with a combined 154 billion dollars total assets after becoming a billionaire letter think does what all billionaires do collecting arts he believes that arts and real estate are the two greatest stores of wealth in the world and investors with a greater than 100k portfolio should use arts as a better inflation hedge than gold art has benefited immensely from soaring costs according to data from city in fact they reported that contemporary art prices appreciated by 23.2 percent versus 3.8 for the s p 500 during periods of 3 inflation or higher like right now but unless you have 100 million dollars in the bank you could never take a proper stake in this asset class until now masterworks dot il acquires multi-million dollar paintings by famous artists like basquiat and banksy and allows anyone to invest in them just like picking stocks online and they built an innovative platform that they recently raised 110 million dollars in sears a funding at a valuation over one billion dollars to securitize each painting filed with the sec and issue shares representing an investment in an art piece on their platform that investors can either hold or until masterworks sell the painting or sell to other masterworks members on their platform investors already saw a 32 annualized price appreciation from the sale of their banking painting metaphyse now thanks to masterworks i'm an investor in basquiat and i invite you to do the same through the link in the description you will skip the wait list and get priority access to invest like me and larry by the time it went public in 1999 blackrock became the fifth largest publicly traded asset manager in america but fink wants to be number one over the next five years blackrock continues to grow accumulating 400 billion assets in little over 10 years thinks blackrock has grown to be a monster and this monster only wants one thing to get bigger in the mid 90s the united states saw a strong economic recovery like never before during clinton's second term unemployment failed the stock market surged and america once again became the epic center of the technological revolution raised during the turbulent 60s and economic recession fink joined wall street after creating his job at first boston fink started blackrock a decade later blackrock became the most formidable force on wall street with hundreds of billions of dollars under management but underneath the prosperity a crisis is brewing the financial derivatives that think helped develop in the 80s have now transformed into a ticking time bomb in december 2000 congress passed the commodity futures modernization act a band any regulation of derivatives [Music] investment banks make billions through the business of securitization this business links investment banks insurance companies and reading agencies together connecting trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans with investors all over the world the essence of it all is about shifting risks or rather socializing risks and privatizing profits but the risk is still there since anyone could get a mortgage real estate prices skyrocketed real estate is real they can see their asset they can live in their asset they can rent out their asset [Music] there's gripped markets overnight with asian stocks slabs fell off a cliff the largest single point drop in history share prices continued to tumble [Music] in a matter of days one of the pillars of one of the first banks to fail is bear stearn the us government asks the biggest commercial bank jpmorgan chase to bail out bear stearn we we bought bearish turns and it wasn't bailed out by the government the government did a little bit of financing we only did it because we asked you by hank paulson and we thought if it went down that could be a huge crisis for the globe jamie dimon is a shrewdest banker on wall street he's not going to acquire bear stearn at a loss so he dials up larry fink for advice incidentally tim geithner who was orchestrating the deal was already contacting larry fink about bear stearn in normal times this is a conflict of interest but fink was just too good at his job so everyone just ignored it then blackrock is hard again to help rescue aig practically behind every major deal during 2008 blackrock was part of it and as an expert on mortgage-backed securities he was called in to help and to clean up with people like hank paulson and jamie dimon and tim geithner on speed dial larry fink helped engineer a remarkable rescue for the financial industry the financial crisis provided the perfect opportunity for fink to strengthen his position as the new king of wall street [Music] after the housing crisis of 2008 issuing and treating fixed income derivatives are no longer the most desirable business to get into since the early 2000s the internet has become widely available enabling the growth of social networks like facebook and youtube and now we're at 100 000 people so who knows where we're going next um we're hoping to have many more universities by the fall social media enables virtually frictionless mass communication and a fast flow of information think realizes this change will fundamentally alter the finance sector from the wreckage of the 08 disaster one business would explode the etfs the best single thing you could have done was just buy an index fund statistically this is the simplest way to build wealth for probably 99 of investors the markets will grow over the long term and so because of that we can invest into some of these different funds that are available to us every year it turns out that probably two-thirds of the active managers are outperformed by the index and the third that outperform in one year are not the same as the ones who do it the next year in his classic book running walk down wall street burton molokia proposes that a market is essentially random and therefore unbeatable the only rational thing to do is putting money in everything influenced by mokio mutual fund legend john bogle launched the first public index mutual fund in 1975. starting with just 11 million dollars this fund tracked the movement of s p 500. after that many followed suit but these mutual funds did not become publicly traded until 1993 when the first etf spdr came to life in the aftermath of the housing crisis in 2009 blackrock has already begun acquiring etfs starting with ice years from burton sparkley's bank through just three funds you can get exposure to 1500 stocks with minimal fees just like the fishing industry very few people get wealthy by hunting whales most of the revenue comes from smaller fish with large volumes i guess to think he realized that the future of investing is about tapping into the pockets of smaller investors volume over profits blackrock soon controls nearly half of the etfs in america in 2014 alone blackrock raised 103 billion dollars shortly the firm becomes the major shareholder in almost every public company out there they have 50 billion in lockheed martin and northrop grumman each and it's been the most successful it's not a bank it's just an investment company and it's been the most successful in the world so it's it's huge it's massive larry fink now has more potential power to influence the us economy than anyone else he is the j.p morgan of the 21st century and we're the largest pension manager in japan in mexico where we are now becoming we just did an acquisition we're gonna be the largest asset manager in mexico we have one technology pipe worldwide that connects everything we do at the firm used to remain passive think now has become more involved in every company's board so over the last five years we've built up our our corporate stewardship team and i actually believe there's less accountability at boards than there should have been in global companies and so we've now been asking companies please describe your long-term plan you tell us what long-term is but most importantly please just tell us that you reviewed your long-term strategy with your board it means he starts exercising his immense power provided by the old etfs he controls [Music] [Music] you"

    "content": "bell ackman just launched an attack on verbal life by selling short of one billion dollars of the company's stocks betting on its ultimate demise all pyramid schemes will ultimately collapse the only people who make money are those few who are at the top of the pyramid see there's herbalife stock down 14.6 percent this is not the first time ackman attacked the company in a public way he represents the activist investors ones with ruthless ambition to battle corporate america and to make billions [Music] phineas from an early age ackman shows a strong entrepreneurial streak running a cart waxing business to make his own money ackman was always a confident and ambitious young man some even consider him to be arrogant it has to do with the fact that he was born in a very wealthy family beginning in the early 1920s ecmas grandfather built a private real estate business by the time ackman was born his father larry ackman has taken the family's business to a higher level making millions of dollars a year i certainly live in a home where you learn never to give up on pretty much anything mom and dad you know hard-working motivated educated people high ambitions for their kids always talked about setting an example i learned a lot of things from my parents after earning a near perfect sct score ackman is accepted to harvard like all young men growing up in a successful family ackman's father expects his children to one day take over the company after graduation ekman spent two years working for his dad but deep down he wants to create his own business empire one that will trump his fathers the problem is he doesn't know what business to start until he meets the most prominent investor in america warren buffett is the most celebrated investor in the world in his long career he turned a near bankrupt company berkshire hathaway into a 700 billion dollars behemoth with the help of his family's connections bill ackman gets to meet warren buffett in person i do think buffett is the greatest investor and the reason why i believe that is you know just that this is a 50-odd year it's a 60-year track record of compounding at 20 plus percent with a very modest amount of leverage you know in the form of principally insurance float and i just don't think there's a record that compares ackman has found his true calling becoming the next warren buffett the 1990s was a turbulent decade after suffering a recession for the black monday crash the us economy was slow to recover but the stagnation gave rise to a thriving industry the hedge funds operated by opportunistic investors hedge funds made profits when others couldn't inspired by warren buffett bill ackman is ready to build his own berkshire hathaway using his 40 000 savings he starts looking for his first big idea it will come from unusual place i have an old-fashioned belief that i can only should expect to make money and things that i understand and when i say understand i don't mean to understand you know what the product does or anything like that i mean understand what the economics of the business are likely to look at look like 10 years from now or 20 years from now one of eggman's first investments came from an area where he understands better than most people real estates alexander's is a real estate investment trust that owns many retail department stores in new york after donald trump took a 20 stake in the company and started losing money and its well-known mural have been fixtures on route 4 in paramus for 30 years but some say the loan department store no longer could keep up by 1992 the prospect of bankruptcy was looming its shares were trading at eight dollars each ackman knows the company is worth much more he realized that even if the company goes under and their properties get sold in the market they will still be worth a lot ekman bought stocks of the company at a bottom price the investment was a success after the company merged from bankruptcy the stock price started to shoot up agmen sold it for 21 this year almost tripling his original investment after beating the market multiple times ekman is ready to start his own hedge fund [Music] and then i was doing this alone in my dorm room and i've recruited a classmate a guy named dave berkowitz to be part of this two-person wasn't even an investment club at the time and we had fun kind of looking at ideas together and i said look imagine if you could do this and people would pay us to do this and that was the genesis for starting a hedge fund which i did in 1992 called gotham partners leveraging his wealthy network ackman raised 3.2 million dollars for his hedge fund gotham partners started aggressively investing in undervalued stocks generating 20 return in his first year bill eckman then used that track record to raise another 10 million dollars for his fund we can see that from the very beginning ackman was very talented at rallying people for their support whether it is raising money or getting shareholders votes looking at his mentor for inspiration ackman realized he could be an activist investor like the early days of warren buffett and buffett started out managing really an activist hedge fund if you follow him from the 1950s to the late 1960s he managed a what best described as an activist hedge fund there's a reason why activism makes sense in certain cases at some companies the managers kind of forget who they're really working for and it becomes their own play pen and at other managements they're sometimes incompetent not we're not saying often and you know it's the job of a board when that occurs to do something about it and sometimes they don't to become an activist investor ecman would take a large position in a company to advocate change in order to raise the stock price it doesn't take long until an investment opportunity shows up [Music] sitting at the heart of new york the iconic rockefeller center is a large complex consisting of 19 commercial buildings covering 22 acres but by early 90s the real estate market fell apart and in 1990 the whole country it just went very very bad the stock price of rockefeller properties collapsed and the reit was under a lot of financial stress due to its high debt while the company is going through bankruptcy ackman purchases as many shares as he can as an expert in real estate ackman knows the reit is being significantly undervalued he partnered up with the business magnate joseph steinberg together they purchased seven percent of the company and start an attempt to take over eggman's takeover attempt draws a lot of attention for real estate tycoons like sam zell and even david rockefeller himself but ackman was outbidded by forming a partnership with goldman sachs david rockefeller amassed control of the real estate trust although ackman didn't win control in the end his investment paid off the rockefeller play helped gotham finish 1995 with a 39 return everyone was so blown away by this young man who was barely in his 30s although he didn't take over the company he earned the respect of the wall street heavyweights and they became his investors by the late 1990s the hedge funds boomed attracting thousands of vicious young men to the industry bill ackman grew up in a successful family but defying his birthright ackman wants to build his own business empire by age 30 eggman's hedge fund gotham partners quickly grew to worth 500 million dollars he is now the master of the universe but he's too blinded by success to see his downfall gotham golf is a real estate group that controlled two dozen golf courses around the country ackman invested heavily in gotham golf believing that his properties would keep surging in value he was wrong as the real estate value kept declining instead of cutting losses eggman doubles down like buffett and monger if he sees an undervalued asset he makes a very large and concentrated bet diversification is as practice generally makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they're doing diversification is a protection against ignorance i mean if you want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you relative to the market you own everything there's nothing wrong with that i mean that as a perfectly sound approach for somebody who who does not feel they know how to analyze businesses but eggman fails to realize that his hedge fund is not berkshire hathaway and monger can do really long term and concentrated investment that is because their company is not set up as hedge fund one of the great advantages that warren buffett has is he manages a public company doesn't have to worry about investors redeeming their capital the problem with hedge funds is that your money can leave typically every quarter and it's hard to be a long-term investor when your investors can take the running back when akman keeps losing money with gotham golf his investors want out not willing to liquidate his positions ackman tries to raise more money but when that is not nearly enough ackman is forced to come up with a more creative way to save his fund are you happy with your job you're looking to raise your standards raise the quality of your lifestyle and then prepay legal services is an incredible vehicle acme solution comes from a bizarre company prepaid legal service was a multi-level marketing company that sold legal services today it was known as a legal shield the company was heavily shorted on wall street with skeptics charging that pre-paid service was actually a worthless pyramid scheme but akman believed the company was undervalued and built a large position in the company but the stock price was slow to move up and ackman lost his patience to pop up the share price ackman released a public letter on his website boasting how great the company is [Music] it worked the stock price started to rise giving eggman some breathing room but his headache is far from over driven by subprime loans early 2000 was the start of a real estate boom ackman saw a rising level of financial scams and frauds indicating a financial bubble is brewing after investigating a financial company mbia ekman bat the company to fail using credit default swaps although his investment thesis on nbia turned out to be correct his timing was wrong mbi is sue ackman for market manipulation over his prepaid legal service investment legal trouble caused more of his investors to flee desperate ackman decides to make a deal with the most dangerous man on wall street his name is carl [Music] icahn carl aigan is a notorious corporate raider grew up poor in bayside queens karakon joined the booming stock market in the 1960s through decades of corporate battles car icon became the undisputed king of takeovers i own it it's my money i worry about the bottom line because if i lose you know i'm answerable to my bank account car icon was a really tough guy to work with to make a deal with icon it goes to show how desperate bill ackman really was as more investors want their money back ackman is forced to liquidate his stocks even the ones that have huge potential hotwood realty was another reed whose shares were trading at 60 dollars but he thinks the company is worth 140 dollars and it would be a bad idea to dump his holdings in the market he caught up carl icahn icon sees the company to be undervalued as well and is willing to buy eggman shares at 80 20 more than a market price car icon has been investing much longer than bill ackman he knows a bargain when he sees it he also knows that this company is perfect for hostile takeover after acquiring the sheriff and ackman karaike immediately starts a proxy fight to gain control over the company the management i hope would relative fears what icon would do to them if they wins control instead they found a white knight to buy the company car icon shares were acquired for 137 dollars making a stunning 72 percent profit car icon really lived up to his reputation win or lose he always makes more money but now ackman wants a piece of that profit what car icon failed to realize ackman added a clause in the original agreement that if icon makes a profit out of haltwood over 10 percent ackman is entitled to half of it carl icahn has built a career out of fear and intimidation he refuses to pay ackman and threatens to sue him but ackman is not easily scared he sues i come back in the end the court favored ackman and order carl icahn to pay him 9 million dollars when you're talking about people at the top top top top top their competitiveness is rooted in ego to build a new car icon nine million dollars may seem like a pocket change but if there is one thing icon hates the most it is losing and he will get his revenge what ackman failed to learn from buffett is the rule of never lose your money rule number one never lose money rule number two never forget rule number one the last two years have been one of the most unusual times in financial history to protect your money one must find alternative investments that are uncorrelated to the market one such a market is art after all the ultra wealthy people like the hedge fund billionaires i cover put a lot of their personal money in arts from 1995 investing in top contemporary arts have outpaced s p 500 by 174 percent which is 14 per year on average masterworks io the newest 1 billion startup makes it possible for people to invest in multi-million dollar paintings at a fraction of the price your choirs are ranging from 1 to 20 million dollars in value and securitize it through the sec on their platform anyone can invest in those paintings via fractionalized shares just like buying shares in a company and when it comes to returns they were best in class returning 32 net of fees to their investors from the sale of their banksy painting as a special bonus i'm giving you a priority access to invest in this asset class that outpaces gold real estate and stocks their platform typically has a wait list but if you use the unique link in the description you can skip that wait list and have access to their current offerings today after the collabs of gotham partners ackman is wasting no time launching his new fund he raised 50 million dollars to start pershing square capital management eggman now only focuses on activist investing in more liquid public companies you know normally we look for a great business that had lost its way we try to figure out what they had done wrong and then we'd recommend a series of changes after buying a stake in the company that's sort of our core business the essence of acme strategy is the same he looks for companies with a lot of real estate because they're more tangible and have more predictable cash flows and not surprisingly he buys a lot of restaurants and retail stores wendy's didn't start the chicken wars they just ended them in july 2005 pershing square took a 9.9 stake in wendy's he then launched a campaign to get the company to spin off the tam horton's donor chang just a few weeks afterwards wendy's agreed to spin off the news caused the company shareprint to rise to 50 dollars while eggman bought them barely at 30. you know eggman is very loud and public about his investment it works because this windy success got him a lot of investors with this one trade he pretty much resurrected himself after wendy's investment akma made another 100 profits with mcdonald's by 2010 akmas pershing square has become a rising star on wall street with 10 billion assets under management his concentrated investment approach seems to have worked i think what's unusual about us is we're very concentrated we own 10 investments you know a lot of people talk about being concentrated they might have 30 40 50 investments you know their top five are big but we literally own ten things ackman may be right but he fails to see his investment style will soon get him in trouble again he is the largest shareholder in jcp with a whopping 18 in the past he lost 32 million bucks and after hours on the stock reactions to ron johnson's moving out jc penney is a declining department store chain with 689 locations in the united states after taking almost one billion dollar stake in the company ackman fired the ceo and hired a new one from apple ron johnson johnson went on to implement many drastic changes that turn out to be disastrous hedge fund manager and activist shareholder william ackman resigns from the board of jcpenney after a lengthy period in which he forced his own disruptive shake-ups on the companies ackman lost half of his investment in jcpenney to reverse his fortune ackman is again desperately trying to find the next big idea [Music] if you follow what i say write this down you're going to make a minimum of 50 000 this year that's the that's the least amount of money that you're going to make the second year you'll make 125 000 and that's the least amount of money that you're gonna make mark renault hughes started herbalife at the age of 24 out of the back of his car over the next 20 years hughes builds herbalife to a business powerhouse with 1.8 billion dollar sales a year but then at the height of his career he dies from drug overdose at the time herbalife had a very sketchy sales practice with the death of the founder they're looking for a new ceo and they're also looking to rebrand themselves to look more legitimate then they found the perfect man for the job before herbalife mike johnson was an acclaimed marketing executive during his 17 years working for disney he brought in over 1 billion dollars in revenue for his department with johnson in charge herbalife started to rebrand itself to be more illegitimate i don't think the herbalife today is the herbalife of what it was years ago and i know that michael johnson has tried to clean up the business a bit so that it's not entirely based on recruiting to make up for his jc painting blunder bill ackman needs to find his next big investment in the case of herbalife i'm not a shareholder pushing uh to make a business more valuable i'm an investor who's made a bet that the business will fail we're short the stock and what we are doing is we believe that herbalife is operating a pyramid scheme we believe that they're transferring wealth from a very large number of low-income principally hispanic individuals in this country and around the around the globe to a handful of wealthy people knowing bill ackman is not going to do it in a quiet way he will publicly execute the company [Music] forty to fifty percent of the revenues of the company come from a business business method called a nutrition club which itself is entirely fraudulent um they've got fake customers these are not customers these are people who are buying into a mini pyramid scheme all right there's nothing circumstantial about it we have facts our cfo called mr ackman this morning and asked him to participate mr ekman said no then he refused now we know what this has been going on for in the shadows as we say for the last eight months this has been ridiculous what's happening here we're not a pyramid scheme that's a bogus accusation herbalife immediately starts a puppet campaign to fight back but it does little to boost the shattered confidence of investors driving his stock price to a new 52-week low just when all hope is lost mike johnson gets an unexpected visit from another hedge fund manager his name is dan lope dan loeb an opportunistic capitalist made his fortune as an activist investor like ackman today his hedge fund third point has 15 billion dollars assets under management load was also a famous short seller but he sees herbalife as an opportunity to profit by triggering a short squeeze [Music] loeb is of the same you know generational age is ackman another sort of smart and handsome guy who gets a lot of press and for good reasons his performance has been fantastic he runs third point llc he emerges he comes out of the blue with a big position long herbalife so he was in favor of a verbal life and that really shook ackman then lobe used to be ackman's friend now he's trying to screw him over it goes to show that there are no real friends on wall street the portrayal of lope cost ackman tens and millions but this is just a start eggman's herbalife short makes him vulnerable and his enemy knows it through years of boardroom battles car icon has garnered an astonishing fortune by 2014 karakan was worth 25 billion dollars car icon doesn't answer to anyone he trades his own money he can go to distance to force his opponent into submission after losing 9 million dollars to ackman in 2010 icon has been waiting for an opportunity to hurt him back he sees herbalife short as the perfect opportunity to enact revenge on bill ackman wasting note tying icon starts building a large position on herbalife i think herbalife is a great company it makes great product with the support of mike johnson icon acquired two seats at herbalife's board they then bring on the former u.s surgeon general dr richard carmona to the board further strengthening the company's legitimacy the sheer price soared 100 percent as a result to akmin this is nothing short of a declaration of war and i'm telling you he's like the crybaby in the schoolyard you know i went to a tough school in queens and they used to beat up the little jewish boys and he was like one of these little jewish boys crying that the world was taking advantage of him bill ackman was underestimated before he's not going down without a fight agma's first defense was to replace half as short positions with put options put option is nothing more than an insurance contract on the value of a stock at the same time bill ackman doubles down on his effort to lobby the government to shut down herbalife ftc and fbi opened investigation on herbalife which slashed the company's stock price by 14 but in a shocking turn ftc didn't find herbalife to be a pyramid scheme it's a case of good news bad news for embattled company herbalife the federal trade commission will not classify it as a pyramid scheme but in return herbalife will pay a settlement of 200 million dollars it is time for ackman to wind down his positions but then he receives a phone call for none other than his nemesis carl icahn after the ftc verdict car icon was looking to exit his positions at herbalife but he can just dump his shares in the market which will cause a panic he's looking to sell half of his cheers to someone who's willing to buy and that someone is bill ackman but that was a mistake bill ackman used this chance to get revenge on icon for what he did to him he leaks the information to the press immediately causing a panic in the market the battle of the wall street billionaires gets another twist carl icahn recently discussed selling his whole stake in nutritional foods company herbal life to his arch nemesis william ackman among others to calm the market car icon was forced to buy more herbalife once again two billionaires are at a standstill but to bill ackman herbalife is the least of his concern for now his real trouble has just begun [Music] by the 21st century with the emergence of large etfs american companies have become complacent as their biggest shareholders tend to be passive funds this gives rise to the activist hedge funds who rally those colossal etfs to be more active leading the charge is bill ackman who through his high profile campaigns has changed the way many companies operate in doing so he's made billions after shorting herbalife he found himself locked in a battle with the most formidable investor on wall street carl icahn the emergence of icon cost ackman hundreds of millions while the herbalife battles continues on ackman finds himself in another fight except this time it may be the innocent [Applause] valiant's for bear were or kind of its origin was a company called bioville which is a corporate clogged toilet based in in canada we've got a merger in the medicine business in 2010 there was a sort of a merger of equals with valiant pharmaceutical valiant planted a foreign flag to save money as a way to skip paying taxes stateside and a guy named mike pearson took over the remaining company our job is to create shareholder value and um so people shouldn't be afraid of of anything that happens that helps them create shareholder value that's that's our job bill ackman believes valiant to be the next berkshire hathaway its growth strategy is not driven by new products but by acquiring other companies except warren buffett's berkshire hathaway is not a pharmaceutical company it is insurance company whose business model is about collecting people's money based on future promises i mean this is a company that buys drugs as we know it hikes prices even though they claim that's not a big part of their strategy we believe it is i think that that whole model of not spending on r d and purchasing drugs gave the company a pass that now they're maybe not getting pharmacy facing a backlash from accusations about its relationship with high-flying drug maker valiant pharmaceuticals shutting its doors closing philidor is the name it announced you know what we have to wind down our principal operations done closed goodbye agmen's world is tumbling down [Music] why would you not recommend to the board that you know over a 30 increase for one year i would think that's that's a pretty good return rate um why don't you charge 3 000 for that look at something we'll discuss tomorrow you will discuss dropping the price of isopropyl to 3 000 because that's over 30 percent increase in the original price so we will absolutely discuss okay the failure of valiant is a devastating blow to bill ackman to make matters worse herbalife stocks stabilized and are slowly recovering eggman's perching square starts facing redemptions again [Music] always have the view that how successful you are is really a function of how you deal with failure and if you deal with failure well and you persist you know you have a high probability of being successful so i've always kind of had that view and then i've had to apply it to myself you know certainly a few times and i always like to say that experience is making mistakes and learning from them and i've had the benefit of having made a lot of mistakes ackman learned from his previous hedge fund that redemptions can be very scary that's why he went public in london exchange this time he's not going down by 2019 after breaking even for nearly three years his fund made 57 return agma's pershing square is making a comeback but his resurgence will be challenged by the most unexpected crisis of mankind [Music] eggman has learned from his past mistakes that one should always have insurance against the worst case scenario by the beginning of march 2020 ackman plays a hedge using credit default swaps then he went on tv to warn the public hell is coming okay and i i felt you know it's really i've never had this experience before in my life the closest i had was the financial crisis where i'm saying you know things are coming bad stuff's coming um but this was a feeling like i've never had like there's a tsunami coming right the tsunami's coming in you feel it in the air as kovac gets worse in america the market begins to fall and all this has rocked financial markets around the world the worst sell-off on wall street since the financial crisis in 2008. in a few months time ecmas hedge generated over 2 billion profit [Music] after closing the short positions on herbalife ackman has decided to never go short on another company we're generally long only in terms of we own things we don't short stocks we did a couple times famously in the past but but not going forward he has gone back to a circle of confidence companies with large real estate presence at the same time car icon has exited his positions with herbalife eating a decade-long beef with ackman [Music] [Music] [Music] you"

    "content": "[Music] the booming economy of the 1980s created a new class of investors car icon grew up poor and bayside queens but through brute force and intimidation he became the most feared man in corporate america [Music] carl icahn's childhood couldn't be more normal he had loving but strict jewish parents they lived in a modest house in bayside queens but his parents were content taking pride for being among the working people but from an early age car i can craze for something more something better and he knows it isn't going to be handed to him [Music] he was a smart boy but he was a total loner spending all day just reading books with work ethic car icon becomes the top student of this class and is offered a scholarship for an elite private high school this is a chance for a brighter future but to icon's great disappointment his parents turn it down car icon's parents worried that private school might make icon a spoiled brat losing touch with reality and of course he had to listen to his parents by going to a public school for the first time karakum feels not be in control over his destiny it was a pretty tough high school it's closed now and i grew up in the bay's water which is far rockaway and uh it was a pretty tough neighborhood baikon continues to dream big he stays quiet studying even harder because his dream is the ivy league his ambition is quickly shut down by his teachers who remind him that no one has ever gotten into the ivy league from his high school today if you listen to car icon he talks with that mobster accent that is because he had to survive his high school and he had to become street smart which is so important for his future success his determination pays off icon was accepted by princeton university the first ever in the history of his school although extremely proud of their son icon's parents couldn't afford to pay for the expenses my father said you know son i'm thinking about you if you insist on going to princeton we decided we'll pay the tuition i said great thanks dad i really appreciate it but not the room and board so i said wait a minute how do i live how do i eat he said you're a smart kid i've watched you you'll figure it out icon did figure out a way to make money it is by playing poker every week i'd win i don't know four or five hundred bucks three hundred bucks i every at the end of the summer i had two grand two thousand and that's when reuben board was only 750. [Music] at princeton the socially isolated car icon is again out of his element he devotes his entire day to studying philosophy and his knight to playing poker and chess eventually becoming the best player on campus what we want to get across is the senior thesis represents one of the greatest opportunities a man has in this place if we could show a visitor some of the titles he'd see what we mean his efforts were not in vain his graduate paper won the best senior thesis of the year the most important thing cara can learn is to rely on his own reasoning process he thinks independently before listening to other people i think that's a common characteristic for many great investors we don't often take the time to step back and ask why do we have good reasons philosophy invites us to do that kind of stepping back it involves the critical scrutiny of our fundamental beliefs and convictions about the nature of reality about knowledge and about value but icon finds himself stuck at job hunting he joined army reserves and also became a cashier at macy's 25 three quarters for 100 cmf sold with the help of his wealthy uncle icon became a stock broker riding the bulk market of the early 60s icon's career takes off when i got into wall street i had 12 15 000 which was a lot saved you know i started investing it and i'm buying all these stocks i'm picking this and i'm picking that and i had a following of people would listen to me oh wow you could but everybody was making money [Music] so i went out i remember once i bought a galaxy convertible then it was a beautiful car i had a beautiful girlfriend he was a model it was just pretty nice like his usual self he spends all of his spare time reading books and learning about the stock market then the market teaches him a lesson that he will never forget what happened the crash came in 1962 i was wiped out in one day i didn't even have the poker when he slept that was a day after what was called the flash crash that's a day in which the dow lost 5.8 percent and at that point in time this was the biggest point loss that they had seen since the great depression this of course was before people had a bloomberg terminal or the internet or tv stations that would give you instant access to stock prices only ticker tapes could do that and there was so much volume on that day that it actually took the tapes hours after the close that day to print all the trade people didn't know for probably three hours after the close how much money they'd actually lost on that day so you can imagine what they were feeling you had to go through the pain you have to go through it the market is not a gambling casino and too many people in this type of market too many people think it is to get back in the game he needs to find his edge and it will come from an unlikely place the late 1950s saw a booming economy like no other but underneath the prosperity a crisis was brewing and america was going to be forever disrupted determined to become rich icon joined wall street but when the bubble burst he lost all of his money bakar aikon is a relentless man he knows there's a weight back in the game and in short order he finds a niche market about to explode i had a few bucks laughed very little and i said i got to learn something so i read a lot about put some calls and in those days that was really the wild west the puts and calls icon realized the options market has the potential to revolutionize the finance industry and make them rich in the process when you buy insurance on your house it's like buying a put option on your house although it may be not directly connected to the home's value but right when you buy a insurance policy in your house and the house burns down you collect on the insurance policy well the price of your house fell to zero if you had bought a put option on the house it would do the same thing right you would have a option to sell it at a high price or something that's now worthless he finds a job as option broker for an unknown company called gruntal just like cryptocurrency today options market were full of scams and price manipulations always doing things differently icon decides he will become the first honest broker putting his clients interests first and delivering more on what he promises and you had all these option brokers if you remember and they were fleecing everybody so i was the honest broker so to speak i come in and tell everybody put out a midweek option and i'd stay up every night calling people that write in for my report and i'd be calling them from cal to california and i've had a big following in options and i give them more than they thought they would get which i couldn't believe here's a guy that oh no from new york calling these this wealthy guy and he'll sell 10 calls on this stock and i'll do it for five grand i get him sixth grade the guy couldn't believe it icon has struck gold in a few years car icon builds the options business into the most profitable department at gruntal after accumulating a list of wealthy clients icon decides to start his own brokerage firm we built up a big following in 68 bought the seat on the stock exchange with the help of one of my uncles and uh by that time i saved a pretty big amount of money for those days in the late 1960s while the country was in turmoil carl icahn's career has arrived at a new height while average middle class like his parents make barely ten thousand dollars a year his personal income has inflated to three hundred fifty thousand dollars a year i was once the rich uncle now he's the rich matthew and also inflated is his lifestyle he starts spending his weekends at hamptons going on dates with fashion models money is no longer an object for him the car icon is actually driven more by power and control first he took control of his own life now he's thinking what else is there for me to control his brokerage business has created a consistent stream of income karaika now wants to invest his profits and then i got into arbitrage you could buy different convertible bonds and short the stocks against them you had no risk but you could make a lot of money and eventually we did real well with that in the few short years arbitrage became his most profitable department but then i can punish the question if he could do arbitrage like that with convertible bonds can he do the same to corporations that are undervalued in their pursuit of profits the pioneers like rockefeller and carnegie were among the first to embrace modern corporations in which shareholders and the management work together for a common goal but by the 1960s car icon has observed that it is no longer the case for many companies but basically you look for the reason that they're they're they're really cheap and the major reason is often and usually uh very poor management so in a sense it's like an arbitrage you go in you buy a lot of stock in the company and you then try to make changes at the company once it takes control of the company he can replace the management to unlock more value a simple proposition yet extremely difficult to execute [Applause] icon's first target was a small appliance company japan car icon discovered that his book value was twice as much as his market price if he could find a buyer for the company close to the book value then he is set to double his money remember icon was a savvy chess and poker player he thinks many many steps ahead of everybody else he thinks about different possibilities and different outcomes and how to deal with them [Music] begins accumulating shares of japan then he makes a phone call to the president of the company icon of course had done a lot of homework but during that phone call he pretended to be very naive and the president of company was thinking that he was some dumb rich kid all of this allowed icon to quietly build up 3 million dollars controlling positions without showing his true intentions by now icon has acquired enough shares to be the biggest shareholder for the company and all of a sudden icon informs the management that he would like for the company to be acquired but he would also like to keep being a passive investor what the hell does that mean this is a classic car icon he never shows his true intentions his intent is to create frustration that his opponent makes mistakes but secretly icon's working hard to buying more shears and to find a company that will acquire japan [Music] once the management realized that icon's intention was hostile they decided to create a poison pill by trying to dilute icons shears so a poison pill is a contract between the company and its transfer agent that if it's triggered imposes massive economic dilution on the bad actor the person who's trying to acquire the company or increasing their position in a way that the board doesn't find acceptable that was a mistake using poison pill allows icon the perfect excuse to convince other shareholders that a management is incompetent and only looks out for itself since the shareholders meeting is coming up he rallies the shareholders to vote for him to become a board member once carl icon became a board member he threatens to fire all other board members unless they do exactly what he says at this point icon has created such a terror that all the board members were looking out for themselves with that the board found a buyer another appliance company agrees to acquire japan for 18 a year this means in less than a year carl makes 2.7 million dollars profit in this first takeover this victory made icon realize that there's so much hidden value in america's capitalist system they're hidden because they're not enough people with guts to take on establishment car icon a man with ivy league education and street smart is more capable than anyone to take on corporate america and his timing couldn't be more perfect the 80s became the golden decade for takeover artists the highest order of business before the nation is to restore our economic prosperity companies are highly leveraged with virtually unlimited cash whenever they're threatened the company would just pay off raiders by offering them green mails so i come outside with them said look he said they don't like you at all if you start buying more stock we're going to dilute the hell out of you so now on the other side of the coin we'll give you you don't have the stock too long we'll give you a 10 million dollar profit to walk away he looks at me says you want some time to think about i said no i'll take the 10 million as car icon targets more companies he amasses unprecedented fortunes [Music] regular family they the husband works and there's always something at least financially to look forward they're building i mean here it's not i mean how much more if he makes it's not going to make any difference but even the smartest people make mistakes and carl icahn is about to face his biggest challenge yet [Music] twa presents the difference between getting away and leading the way with immense competition and unionization airlines have become unable to make profits it's been a disaster for capital i mean it's got glamour to it so you can all you can always get guys to put some money up for an airline car icon is about to be that guy he believes twa was undervalued because it has strong cash flows if he takes control of the airline he can find ways to cut costs making it profitable which will increase its share price icon begins buying twa stock for 9.5 dollars per share less than the company's book value in just a few months time icon acquire 20 percent of tw's equity like his usual move icon appears to be innocent and harmless promising that he's looking out for the long term of the company at this point icon has already built a reputation for being a ruthless raider the management immediately strikes back twa was a major airline at the time therefore it had the ability to influence politics the first counter-attack from twa is to convince the government to block icon for exercising shares but in a surprise turn of events the legislators have grown tired of twa's underperformance they decide not to block car icon from seeking control of the company but the twa's management is just as relentless they quickly initiates their second counter attack which is fighting a white knight a friendlier buyer after a few candidates they found a texas ear which is surprisingly run by another corporate raider who also grew up from queens frank lorenzo they offered a near 22 dollars per share to acquire twa icon bought the company at about ten dollars a share he could exit now and make 100 return but this isn't about money anymore this is about winning this is about control always the strategist icon knows that his enemy's enemy is going to be his friend icon managed to get something twa's management could not get labor concessions the unions pilots and machinists agreed to approximately 20 in salary cuts in exchange for a small piece of the company if icon took over they wanted icon to come in because twa had announced a merger with texas air president frank lorenzo lorenzo was known for being tough on unions with the support of unions icon defeats lorenzo and successfully takes over twa i who know nothing about management could do what i did at acf and again i'm not i'm not employed myself i've said it's a sad commentary it really i'm telling you that i'm not that great at management icom is about to violate his own role he becomes the managing chairman of twa i can fantasize about becoming a titan like rockefeller or howard hughes and he let that get inside his head icon begins to cut salaries shutting down in freaking flies a year later tw achieved an improvement in profits we took twa from losing and today we're making we just have recordings of 300 million but it came at a hidden cost icon has cut the salaries of flight attendants and anger starts to build up i don't think he has twa in his best interests nor has he ever had two in his best interests but for now the business seems to be thriving and that is good enough for icon to exit with a cash flow the company has now generated icon takes the company private what it means is that he used the company's money to buy back all the public shares it also means that he just paid himself a lot of money if he could live on 105 a week before long the company's in trouble again [Music] they're 18 year old people and they're happy to do this job they love it this time everyone is against karaikum is then ousted as a chairman in spite of that i can still make many times over his original investment but twa continued to struggle and filed for bankruptcy in 1997. the 80s booming economy created a special class of investors the takeover artists car icon is the undisputed king of takeovers through his countless battles against corporations caracan became the most feared raider in america after raking hundreds of millions from twa he has built a fearsome personal brand the mission of his name can create shocks to the stock market but time has changed corporate rating has now become widely accepted as shareholder activism well i think the main thing that has been happening now is you have this bloom of hedge fund activism and a lot of that has been driven by you know the complicit uh passive investors behind the scenes the big institutions and all of sudden people realize that what icon has been doing could be beneficial to corporate america after the housing crisis of 2008 icon went on the buying spree he purchased netflix in 2003 and managed to get ebay to spin up paypal at that same year but then he set his aim at a bigger target he was going to take on tim cook [Applause] is it possible that apple was undervalued because of tim cook i met tim cook because at that time there were guys calling me and saying hey we got to get rid of this tim cook and i met him and i said this guy's great impressed by tim cook icon started heavily investing in apple by the time he exited his positions in 2016 i can make two billion dollars on his apple investment making money has become too easy for car icon with his reputation he can raise the stock price just by pretending to take over a company baikon enjoys winning more than anything else sometimes he looks for a good fight and he's about to face his toughest opponent [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you"

    "content": "[Music] despite nearly all national polls showing him behind before the voting started donald trump is now president-elect trump the rise of donald trump came as a shock to everyone started as a publicity stunt trump's campaign became the ultimate black sheep his victory left people baffled no one saw this coming as you pointed out donald trump was not only an underdog he had his back against the wall how did he do it what trump did very effectively is tap the angst and the anger and the hurt and the pain that millions of working-class people are feeling and soon the big boss behind donald trump finally surfaced it was the ceo of a 160 billion hedge fund robert mercer ladies and gentlemen i am officially running for president of the united states and we are going to make our country great again [Applause] [Music] when trump announced his bid for the presidency hardly anyone took him seriously by the summer of 2016 trump's campaign was losing steam a victory seemed impossible during his speeches trump wouldn't stay on message and he couldn't handle the embarrassing leaks [Music] republican donors were skipping ships it seems all but inevitable that clinton would win then trump's daughter ivanka received a phone call from rebecca mercer the daughter of a mysterious hedge fund billionaire robert mercer he's a renowned computer scientist who had a strong resentment towards clinton became trump's biggest financial supporter mercer brought steve bannon and callion conway from obscurity and inserted them into trump's campaign stabilizing it during a difficult period as an artificial intelligence expert mercer knew that with advanced data science voters behavior can be understood and therefore influenced to trump's advantage his tech company cambridge analytica uses algorithms to help trump craft every message and actions and we can match what you watch in a way that we can begin to select programs to advertise in that have the highest density of the target audience that we're trying to reach growing up in new mexico the introverted robert mercer had a passion for everything techy leading him to pursue a phd in computer science after working for a government-funded laboratory mercer was frustrated by the inefficiencies and the bureaucracies of the government he took a job at ibm and went on to become a pioneer in computer linguistics he was so talented that he caught the attention of wall street he was recruited by renaissance technologies to develop computer models for trading stocks he became the key figure that allowed rentec to grow 10 times bigger in 10 years [Music] and he also became a billionaire himself with all that money robert mercer wanted to change america by bringing back conservative politics since 2008 robert mercer have been making sizeable political donations all to conservative candidates by 2014 republicans want control of the senate and the house this was a wave a republican wave that hit and hit the democrats and the president hard and every race that was broke at the end broken the republicans favor about 2016 with all that money and power robert mercer along with his daughter rebecca mercer almost single-handedly put donald trump in office [Music] that is not the first time a hedge fund manager exerts such a powerful influence on american politics on the other side of the political spectrum george soros has been advancing his leftist movement for decades wealthy people have been influencing american politics for centuries but what makes hedge fund managers especially powerful is because their wealth is more liquid and less constrained many hedge funds trade rapidly which means they can liquidate to cash much more quickly than for example tech billionaires like elon musk and they don't have to report to the sec when they do as a result of freedom from regulations and a strong incentive to make profits hedge funds actions have been increasingly affecting american affairs than ever before after years of reporting about wealthy people and companies journalist alfred winslow jones decided to start an investment company himself but at that time he doesn't want to sacrifice his freedom and privacy he envisioned an investment fund that is free from government and market forces and his performance will be solely based on how good his stock picking skill is he came out with the idea of hedge fund with every trade he's insured by having a short position to cancel out the market impact in the meantime he kept the number of the potential investors to be less than 100 to avoid registration with the sec and he only raised money from wealthy people this was the first hedge fund in history little did jones know his simple yet brilliant idea will one day become a four trillion dollar industry that affects almost every aspect of america the birth of hedge funds created a new way for wealthy people to get wealthier they're free to use any strategies to make money hedge funds use their investments for hostile takeovers currency speculations or to invest in exotic assets by the 21st century there were more hedge funds than a number of public companies hedge fund managers started showing up on the forbes richest list banks pension funds and endowments all become investors of hedge funds around 1990 nearly all the money in hedge funds was from rich individuals by now about two-thirds of the money in hedge funds comes from institutions and that's a transformation and so it means that university college endowments have their money in hedge funds retirement systems put their money in hedge funds non-profits like the one i work for the council on foreign relations they invest the endowment that's funding the research in hedge funds in this documentary we want to bring awareness about the extent of influence hedge funds have on america the 33 euro icon just bought enough shares to become a major shareholder for public company after an intense meeting with the board when he presented his plan for the company that will maximize shareholders value icon is eagerly waiting to hear back from the company's management by the age of 30 carl icon had built a successful brokerage business making him a millionaire but icon wanted more recently he has been testing his new theory that the management teams and american companies a bunch of cowards he can buy enough shares to become a major shareholder and use that power to change the company's management and the company's share price shall rise in other words he's going to do hostile takeovers after the board meeting the management did not like his proposal but icon decided that he will not go down without a fight he told the management that he will go for a proxy battle in order to get his proposal approved by shareholders a proxy battle is an effort by a shareholder of a corporation to convince other shareholders to cast their corporate votes but instead the management decided to pay him off by offering him 10 million dollars just to walk away so that the management can keep their jobs this is what's called a green male carl icon had an epiphany he has found a weakness in american capitalist system to make money all he has to do is to threaten to take over a company and the management will pay him a green mail to walk away if not he can fire the management and hire new ones either way the share price will rise this realization will enable carl icon to terrorize corporate america for the coming decades amassing nations greatest fortunes in the process it's my money i worry about the bottom line because if i lose you know i'm answerable to my bank account in the 80s corporate rating became one of the most profitable businesses for hedge funds readers as they were called back then will accumulate controlling positions in a company and they make profits by splitting the company up or selling some of the company's assets while some of them did end up benefiting the shareholders a lot of raiders tend to be short-term driven often making profits for themselves while other long-term shareholders lose money these hedge funds often have the money and the clout to take over company and fundamentally change its directions even for a company like disney was a target of a corporate rating during the 80s and 90s disney had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars just to fend up corporate raiders who tried to liquidate disney's assets for profits what if disney somehow was liquidated or sold for parts would the world be like today targeting a company is one thing but some hedge funds have gathered enough money and resources to target an entire country [Music] that the pound was being suspended from the erm the bank of england just lost some tens of billions of pounds prior to that the bank of england was a target of attack by a group of currency speculators led by george soros when british government decided to raise interest rates in order to stop the pressure on sterling i said to my partner now this is the wrong policy for the british government in the in the long term they cannot sustain this therefore you can sell any amount of sterling because it cannot be maintained george soros quantum font has become a force to be reckoned with this hedge fund is unlike any other george soros strategy focuses on timing and predicting various economic cycles and trends he is what's called a macro trader he trades market indices and currencies but unlike other macro hedge funds he doesn't really hedge he has so much conviction in every bet that he will risk all of his portfolio with one bet the strategy worked for him by the 1990s it made him billions as the size of funk grew soros has become the catalyst triggering economic crises and profiting from them by early 1992 he saw a perfect opportunity like that in england the star was so short about 7 billion dollars worth of sterling soros also bought 500 million dollars worth of british stocks as a parallel play because equities often rise after a currency devaluation he didn't stop there he also bought german and french bonds while shorting those countries equities because of his drunk credit charles only had to put down 1 billion dollars in collateral to do all of this he was leveraged one to ten which was extremely risky but soros had a strong conviction that he was right and just as predicted he made one billion dollars from this series of trades he was called the man who broke the bank of england making him one of the most notorious currency speculators in the world [Music] zoro's quantum fund's performance has been so large and so consistent that even warren buffett's returns are pale in comparison but sorrows had a bigger ambition like many billionaires he donated money to charities started by himself which allowed him to influence geopolitics around the world for a long time he has been the biggest benefactor for clinton's politically he is the opposite of robert mercer the only thing they have in common is that they're both hedge fund managers with immense power now stands a reason to have money and power all you got to do is start a hedge fund and make it a success not quite you see the success of robert mercer is a result of using advanced trading algorithms ironically his success has made the market less accessible to the little guys over the years with the evidence of electronic trading and advances in science and technology the market is getting increasingly complicated the ways hedge funds make money are getting more sophisticated as well [Applause] sometimes you meet a person a counterparty and they'd have something you want but to trade you needed to have something they want and it had to be the right quantity the odds of that weren't high and until you found a match you'd either have to wait or sell at a price lower than you wanted now imagine there's a person standing at the center of this marketplace he or she is willing to trade with everyone if you want to buy something they'll sell it if you want to sell something they'll buy it this person is making a market market making has become a profitable business for the hedge funds to market makers they care more about volumes than about asset prices they want more people to gamble by doing so they practically become the casino taking small profits from every bed that you make there is nothing wrong with making money as a honest market maker but in the end you realize that the more you trade the richer they become robin hood turned the online brokerage industry on its head by offering free trading but if the trading is free how does robinhood actually make money although robinhood has freight commissions the buyers and sellers on robinhood actually pay a fee in the end because their orders are being routed to market makers like citadel but when hedge funds want to trade they don't use robin hood or similar platforms they trade in what is called a dark pool where only sharks are allowed the fact that almost half of all trading is happening off exchange and in some retail heavy names you're seeing more than 70 percent of the volume executed in these internalizers or wholesaling systems and that's damaging the markets it's widening spreads and it's a significant information advantage for all for those two firms citadel and virtue who operated do a de facto duopoly in the internalization market since the financial crisis of 08 the hedge fund industry has been declining but at the same time the top hedge funds still control many major aspects of america the hedge fund industry has grown up it now manages by some estimates three trillion dollars globally and the people running the most successful hedge funds are amassing unprecedented personal fortunes i mean really on a scale we haven't seen since the robber baron you know andrew carnegie days and they are doing this through financial speculation moving money around taking money turning it into more money by kind of speculating in the market they create relatively few jobs many of them in the u.s pay lower taxes than a salaried employee a secretary due to lobbying in various loopholes and um you know they take a lot out of the system so i just think it's important for people to pay attention to what they're doing they're lightly regulated they're constantly fighting against increased regulation and transparency from activist hedge funds trying to take on big corporations to market makers making profits in robin hood hedge funds are still making impacts that are felt everywhere at the bottom of it all is about profit seeking without constraints if hedge funds are solely made up by wealthy people's money they can gamble a little but nowadays if a large hedge fund like bridgewater fails a lot of people's pension money teachers pension money will be gone at this point it is unclear what will happen in the hedge fund industry in the future but one thing is certain as long as capitalism exists there will always be someone with immense amount of money that has the ability to influence the fate of an entire nation all we can do is to shine enough exposure on them to limit their ability to do evil [Music] [Music] you"

    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azLvQJUJyIQ",
    "content": "by the late 20th century a new breed of money managers is emerging paul tudor jones is one of the most profitable traders ever who through sheer wealth power and calculated risk taking turn a small time hedge fund into an empire pot tudor jones ii was born into a wealthy family in memphis tennessee his father was a lawyer who also ran the family's publishing business jones went to the university of virginia where he was a welterweight boxing champion he was a tough guy often beating the hell of his opponent i think that competitiveness that desire to win very much defined his character [Applause] even though his family was rich paul tudor jones still had to work to pay for his tuition as a writer for his family's newspaper the single most important thing you need to learn for any job in business is how to communicate how to write a memo how to talk how to think the easiest way to learn how to do that is to take journalism 101 newspaper writing during college part twitter jones developed a liking for competitive mind games i played a whole bunch of games uh chess bad game when i was older when i was in college i was the booking opportunity so i had by the time i graduated from college i already had probably at least a master's in probabilistic theory jones soon realizes that there is no better game than a game of the financial market my senior year uh the guy that i inherited the book from said to me oh man um you gotta try this soybean futures uh i'm back and we're hedging up they had a huge plantation to time in arkansas we're hedging up our soybean crop and this this just makes this makes football gambling just pale in comparison in 1976 after earning a bachelor's degree in economics paul tudor jones landed a job at the new york cottons exchange at that time commodities trading was really the wild west much like cryptocurrencies today jones started as a float clerk studying the market to figure out what makes it tick he very quickly figures out that the market is not some abstract concept it's just a group of people standing there trying to outsmart each other to win this game all jones has to do is to understand the behavior of the traitors around him like a biologist studying a group of animals jones discovers that there are some patterns of behavior that can be exploited jones sees his future he can outsmart the market and become rich in the process however before jones can take on his great conquest he was fired from his job [Music] and i read a story on a guy named richard dennis who was the biggest local at the board of trade and then he used to say that he did his best trading when he was hungover because there was no emotion i thought hmm this is starting to get close to what i'm culturally pretty good at jones was indeed a drinker and a party animal after a wild night in new orleans he fell asleep at his desk he was fired immediately by his boss paul tutor jones love for the party life will come back and hunt him in the future but for now he learned to separate that from his day-to-day work part twitter jones soon landed a job as a commodities broker for ef hutton buying and selling contracts on behalf of his clients jones excelled at this job in two short years he made over one million dollars from commissions for the next four years paul tudor jones learned the ins and outs of the futures market futures are just contracts that set specific price for a commodity at a future date of course this contract itself has value which is traded in an exchange but there are markets for some of the wildest things and the reason that you have these markets is because when two mutually consenting adults have opposite views and they want to express them then you want to be able to let them do that and allow them to basically either hedge their risks or take on risks that they're able to do although tudor jones makes lucrative commissions by being a broker he also started making money by trading his own account then after a while i realized i could do so much better if i just traded for myself because the commissions back then were nine dollars a contract and i realized i could go trade for myself and clear i think even then clearing was still 30 or 40 cents a contract and just do and i i started doing that for myself and i did really really really successful from the start pretty much but the life on the trading floor is taking a toll on pot tudor jones [Applause] for traders losing voice is a common occupational hazard which pot tudor jones is trying to avoid by 1983 paul tudor jones started his own firm the tudor investment corporation although jones has made millions for himself as a floor trader he understands the power of leverage by trading other people's money and he knows just the people to ask for it paul tudor jones cousin was the ceo of the world's largest cotton merchant he became jones first client i think a lot of the success of these hedge fund billionaires has to do with their network and finance as an industry in particular tends to emphasize more on networking than just skills with enough money at hand tudor jones is not free to trade all kinds of assets during the next few years he was generating double and triple digit returns with only one losing month but the true testament of a trader's ability only comes during the bear market and jones is about to come face to face with the biggest bear since the great depression when ronald reagan took over the presidency american economy boomed however by the late 80s the growth had slowed while inflation was still high the strong dollar was putting pressure on exports the future earnings are going downhill but the stocks are unaffected all of this is a recipe for financial disaster while his peers are unaware of the impending doom pot tudor jones is preparing for the worst case scenario yes there will be some type of a decline without a question in the next 10-20 months and it will be earth-shaking it will be saber-rattling and it'll have wall street in a tizzy and it will create headlines that will be that will dwarf anything that's happened at this point in time but a market boom can last longer than expected and paul tudor jones is attempting the impossible market timing tudor jones hired an economist peter borish who predicted that a crash will happen sometime around the spring of 1988 but on that friday paul tutor jones noticed that s p 500 has gone down a little after years observing the market behavior he was convinced that this is the moment once the market starts to fall then it is unstoppable expecting worse decline to come on monday jones shorted some s p 500 futures in this situation the risk and reward payoff are asymmetric what i mean by that is that if jones is wrong his loss is small but if he's right his returns will be huge good evening today is black monday the day the dow dropped more than 500 points the day the dow dropped more than 22 percent i knew for a fact that if and when it broke because of the derivative structure that the downside was going to be unlimited literally unlimited because there were no limits on futures while the bubble is actualizing jones finds more ways to profit from this crash during a typical financial recession federal reserve tends to pump cash into the system to provide more liquidity jones realizes that if the fed indeed injects more cash into the economy the bunk market will soar but if the fed does nothing the bunk price will stay the same this is another asymmetric bat of course it doesn't know for sure that it will happen but the upside is huge while the downside is very limited these two baths paid off pot trader joe's netted 80 million dollars from his first trade and another 100 million dollars by betting that the fed will prank more money while most traders on wall street were wiped out tudor jones gained 200 percent for that year in finance one of the best ways to make a name for yourself is make money during the bear market winning while everyone else is losing if tutors management was a smart fund them the black money's win has made jones a sensation on wall street now everyone wants to invest with him part twitter jones is now a force to be reckoned with and he wants to enjoy his wealth after every financial crisis there is always anti-wall street sentiment by the mid-1980s jones reportedly was developing a reputation for recording fashion models and parting long into the night the wall street journal ran a front page article referring to jones as a quatron man in a profile covering his lifestyle moved to the u.s in around 1986 i was modeling and came here to model in 1988 jones married sonia klein soon after they moved into greenwich [Music] connecticut a year after black money crashed paul tutor jones saw another financial bubble on the brink of bursting this time it was the japanese equities market post world war ii japan saw unprecedented growth becoming the second largest economy in just a few decades by the 80s economic growth has saturated japan no longer relies on exports for growth and started stimulating the growth by printing more money japan for a long time now has had a situation where very much the stock market and the land market have been based on a um credit type situation people have land they put the land in its collateral buy stocks they didn't put those stocks in is collateral to buy more land jones once again realized that this is not a sustainable situation a crash must happen but they decide not to act quickly because the market tends to experience rallies on the way down as more delusional traders refuse to accept the reality i mean the one thing that that's that i would say i've learned the past 40 years is these you know price patterns and and price stories this it's the same old story so often just just with different characters different times different plots then at the start of 1990 the tokyo market fell nearly four percent in a matter of days after that the market has a few rallies but fell seven percent in february and 13 in march jones timing proved excellent everything happened almost exactly like how he predicted tokyo's market fell steeply from july through early october he shorted the japanese equities market using index futures that year he returned ninety percent on his portfolio largely from his tokyo bet paul trader jones is the ultimate defensive trader he's like the floyd mayweather of finance he's very strategic and very good at avoiding big losses always first and foremost protecting your ass and that's why most people lose money as individual investors or as traders because the fact they're not focusing on losing money they need to focus on the money that they have at risk how much capital is the risk in any single investment they have if everyone spent nine percent of their time on that or the nine percent of their time on pie in the sky ideas about how much money they're going to make then they'd be incredibly successful investors what he means by that is that as a trader you should always have insurance against the worst case scenario while rare events happens rarely but when they do happen they tend to be more catastrophic than you think in the financial terms it is called the tail risk or the black swan event [Music] remote events happen less often but when they happen they command much greater effect on the total properties so the definition of fat tail is a small number of observations in a given data set will represent the bulk of statistical properties paul trader jones has another secret weapon systems thinking rather than looking at assets individually he thinks about the flow of capital throughout the whole system like right now i'm watching the currencies i'm watching crude i'm watching stocks and bonds they're all interrelated you know the whole world is simply nothing but a big flow chart for capital and if i start getting hurt in for instance stocks or bonds then i'm going to make a total portfolio adjustment just because of fact i might not like the way the numbers are going over the course of the day in the game of the financial market paul tudor jones plays it better than most he's an embodiment of a true speculator whose returns are so consistent making every trader jealous as his popularity grew people are watching his every move hoping to uncover the secret for his trading success one of these people is the sec in 1994 paul tudor jones paid a fine of 800 000 dollars to settle allegations of violating the uptick rule which prohibits the sale of a borrowed stock while the stock is declining the early 80s were the golden age for commodities trading the market was new and full of opportunities paul tutor jones grew up with a passion for competitive games he threw himself into the pit becoming a multi-millionaire before age 30. after successfully predicting the black money crash paul tutor jones emerged as a superstar trader on wall street but the world is getting more complicated and no one can win forever in time jones will face his biggest challenge yet [Music] with every crisis there's an opportunity to profit paul twitter jones has become a master at spotting financial crises by the summer of 2008 jones saw that there was going to be a major crisis again perhaps even bigger than a black money crash like what he did during the previous crisis he started shorting index futures but there's a problem employees of lehman brothers today as the wall street giant stock went to zero the collapse of the venerable new york bank follows a tumultuous few months of market volatility being a long-term client paul tudor jones had a hundred million dollars worth of assets at lehman brothers when the bank went bust he lost them all but that was not the end of it jones was not able to liquidate his bump positions in the emerging market because everyone was selling but jones short positions came through offsetting part of his losses he ended 2008 with just four percent down and this is the only negative year he has ever had after that he has become more conservative and his returns have become less outlandish i mean if you look at hedge fund indices over time big funds underperform small funds there's an inverse correlation with size and the returns you generate at the same time futures market has become more matured and information is much more easily accessible when he first started out commodity trading was relatively new and one can almost spot trends with naked eyes in the old days commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend not necessarily the very light trend you see here but but trending in in periods and if you decided okay i'm going to predict today by the average move in the past 20 days there's 20 days maybe that would be a good prediction and i'd make some money and in fact years ago such a system would work not beautifully but it would work so you'd make money you'd lose money and make money but this is a year's worth of days and you you know you'd uh make a little money during that period in order to maintain his performance paul tudor jones has been searching for a new edge ever since early 2000 i have found a solution technology has transformed the world that just 20 years ago even jones couldn't imagine while a great majority of hedge funds is struggling to make profits there is a one group of funds that are making ungodly amount of money simon started a hedge fund over the course of 15 or 20 years he's put together a track record that has literally beaten every other hedge fund manager's track record by a lot he did this by building a quantitative investment management company with 75 phds in mathematics physics computer science and so on it became obvious to portugal jones that the only way forward is to break down his trading principles and turn them into algorithms this is what goat mining looks like in the modern world all of the visible gold has been pretty much gone what is left are the microscopic gold that are barely visible to the naked eye you may be wondering there must be less gold extracted per year wrong goal extraction has actually increased even when jones first started out he was able to spot large patterns that he could exploit but those patterns have faded away just like modern day industrial gold mining quant strategy tend to make small profits consistently which add up to huge returns in the long run in 2002 paul tudor jones co-founded two sigma which later became a quant powerhouse i've been watching paul jr drilling since 2020 what's really impressive about this guy is that he has been making the right predictions all this time he successfully predicted that a market will rebound after march last year he also called it during october last year about the effect of biden's tax plan [Music] [Music] you"

    "content": "fell off a cliff the largest single point drop in his share prices continued to tumble in the aftermath of the lehman while wall street is in panic one hedge fund decided to go big committing billions of dollars to companies near bankruptcy the owner of this hedge fund is mark lasry laser he was a special kind of investor he invests when there's a blood on the street 2008 was a perfect time for that with a bailout or without one the big three automakers will also still have to lay off thousands of workers they are back on capitol hill today asking congress for emergency funds but it became obvious to lazari there is no way that a u.s government will let the auto industry fail imagine the auto industry collapsed the amount of people losing jobs would be unthinkable it was just a matter of time when the congress bails them out the overall amount and cost of financing the restructuring would be significantly higher in a chapter 11 process than the working capital bridge that we're requesting here today before the rest of the market realized that last lassrey zeroed in on a great investment opportunity ford the nation's second largest automaker they began buying 500 million dollars of bank debt by ford at a great discount to face value last week was born in marrakech morocco their parents left morocco in 1966 and moved into a two-bedroom apartment in harvard connecticut where the seven-year-old mark lazary shared a bedroom with his two sisters my father wrote cobalt so he was one of the first people to write computer code my mother was a private school teacher and my sisters and i went to the school where she taught like many immigrant families in america they know education is the only way out i got a great education it was all because of my mom i mean there was a simple role in our house as long as you got a's life was good if you didn't life was bad with the help of scholarships and loans mark lazary attended clark university in worcester massachusetts last year graduated in 1981 with a degree in history and was already enrolled to new york law school however to pay for his tuition lassrey had to take a job as a ups driver if you have a jewish mom you end up either being a lawyer or a doctor i had gotten this great job working at ups as a truck driver and i remember i told my mother i think i could make a career out of this i think i could actually get into management so i'm not going to go to law school you know my mother looked at me and said look you can do whatever you want but it's not your life so [Laughter] um you're going to law school after law school last week clerked for edward ryan chief bankruptcy judge for the southern district of new york going through all the filings and financials last week became an expert on distressed companies and how to profit from them he realized he was looking at a large and relatively untapped market with very little competition when ronald reagan became the u.s president he started a series of deregulation as a result the hedge fund industry boomed the flexible structure allows them to take on all kinds of investments i mean there's so many types of hedge fund managers they're the quants they're the macro guys event driven shops and troll sellers lesbian found out that it is highly profitable to invest in near bankrupt companies when a company is in financial distress the market can be too pessimistic about the company's assets creating an opportunity for investors like lastry their funds later known as vulture funds that specialize purely in distressed debts unbeknownst to lassrey at the time he was looking at an untapped market that would soon make him billions wasting no time lazarus switched career from practicing law to the world of height finance practiced law for about a year and then i got out to go work at an investment firm that specialized in distress it was rd smith so this guy randy smith i did that for about a year i made him 25 million dollars my first year that's why 25 million was huge amounts of money in 1987 he landed a big position at cowan and company we ran partners capital they gave us 25 million we did about 60 a year for about two years it was right around the time his sister sonia gartner had graduated from law school and last week's new department needed a lawyer sue lazaro and sony are making millions in just salaries and bonuses they were doing so well for themselves but they want to start their own firm even though they have made a few million dollars for themselves that's not nearly enough to start a fund instead they want to start a brokerage firm that makes commissions from buying and selling debts on their clients behalf and after the accumulating enough profits then they will form a portfolio their strategy is brilliant and their lives are never the same lassred gartner opened their own boutique distressed brokerage firm in 1990 with one million dollars of their own capital i thought oh it'd be great manage your money and we did really well we sort of doubled the money every year for about five years by 1995 they became one of the biggest private distressed debt brokerage firms that existed at the time by 1995 last rate and gartner formed their first avenue fund with less than 10 million dollars a small amount in the hedge phone world but last week and gartner know they could make more than 50 returns a year eventually more investors welcome in the meantime they start searching for deals they know just where to look there was a company smith international where which was in california was in newport beach smith international was industrial equipment company that sold products to gas and oil companies back then people sort of viewed companies in bankruptcy it's got no value but in smith international you were getting paid somewhere around sort of on the restructuring 75 cents on the dollar and you can buy those claims for anywhere between 10 to 50 cents on the dollar so you just kept buying and really you had to call individual creditors i mean there was no exchange so you would contact individual creditors and you would negotiate with everybody and you'd buy claims one by one um and you know that's sort of how we made a lot of money back then avenue capital typically has about 40 to 50 positions at any one time generally last week wants to have about eighty percent invested with twenty percent cash uh to take advantage of new opportunities and surprisingly they don't have any leverage to enhance their returns just as predicted avenue took off in five years it grew to one billion dollars in early 2000 the hedge fund was consistently making double-digit returns avenue did so well morgan stanley bought a 15 stake in the firm for approximately 250 million dollars but just as they closed their deal a gigantic economic storm has arrived in early 90s u.s was coming off from the black monday crash a new industry is booming a small group of hedge funds discovered that there were fortunes to be made by buying distressed debts les rey and gartner grew up in a middle class immigrant family they became among the first to capitalize this thriving market building their billion dollar hedge fund in just 10 years time but their investment strategy will be tested by the biggest economic recession since the great depression in september 2008 the bankruptcy of the u.s investment bank lehman brothers and the world's largest insurance company aig triggered a financial recession which cost the world tens of trillions of dollars rendered millions of people unemployed and doubled the national debt of the united states avenue capital was already having a rough year with about 25 down but to lancer their losses on paper are just temporary once the market recovers they will go right back to their original levels now is the time to play the offense the financial crisis is making a lot of companies go bankrupt back then everybody thought all these companies were going into bankruptcy the most desperate of them all is six flags six flags is an american company that runs dozens of theme parks in 2004 six flags began to close and sell properties in an effort to help alleviate the company's growing debt to make matters worse on august 29 2005 six flags new orleans park was severely damaged by hurricane katrina and has since been abandoned it was all but inevitable six flags was going bankrupt avenue aggressively started buying six flags bonds about fifty percent discounts to face value again you have to think like a contrarian of course it's a bad company but the market is being too pessimistic about its assets significantly undervaluing them avenue and its hedge fund friends joined the fire sale acquiring 400 million dollars worth of debt with just 200 million dollars by 2009 after chapter 11 restructuring they were handed over 480 million dollars in cash it's 240 return in two years [Music] it can't get better than that [Music] lassrey is a value investor who makes decisions based on intensive fundamental analysis what we're very good at is understanding value so buying something at 60 cents or buying something at 50. i don't know if we're ever going to time the bottom but we'll be very good at buying at pretty low prices but over the last decade the distressed debt markets has become more efficient making it difficult to buy undervalued assets but at the same time there are more opportunities internationally more overseas right now so huge opportunity in europe to be a really successful investor you've got to constantly be buying when other people are selling so i think to be a distress investor you're i think you just have to be able to weather those times [Music] you"

    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJdCqaIIPHQ",
    "content": "[Music] and he has this very compelling almost rags to riches story he grew up very middle class in great neck long island which was an affluent town his family had relatively speaking less money than a lot of others around him so i think from an early age you know he felt a sort of hunger to become rich although cohen wasn't born into money he had a glimpse into what money can buy lived in manhattan cohen's grandparents were very wealthy they often take home to fancy restaurants and shows as a child you're very impressionable i think steve cohen's grandparents lifestyle had a huge impact on him he saw the kind of life that money can buy but at home cohen saw a sharp contrast to the living conditions of his family born in the summer of 1956 cohen was the third of eight children in great neck the colton family were on the low end of the financial spectrum how everyone in this in the family sort of felt that steve would be you know was special their mother his brother remembered their mother cooking uh steak for little steve and making hot dogs for all the other children i mean there was a real sense that steve was special he was really smart he was gonna make a lot of money um and so he was treated he was treated a little differently desperate for money and while still in high school steve cohen found out a sneaky way to make extra cash [Music] as a young man cohen showed an incredible talent for playing poker because what poker really does is teach you how to deal with probabilities and uncertainties and that's so integral to life you know with everything everything we try to do you know should we take this route or that route should i go here on vacation or there it's all about dealing with with uncertainties and probabilities of things happening and and poker is a very fun and easy way to teach someone how to do that colin will sometimes spend all night playing poker frequently making thousands of dollars a night cohen realizes that there are easier ways to make money than a nine to five playing poker can sometimes make him more money than his dad even with a time spending on playing poker cohen still managed to achieve good grades which eventually helped him get accepted to wharton in college the socially rejected cohen resorts to the only activity he finds joy playing poker but he soon grows dissatisfied with the money he wants to try his hands at a bigger casino the financial market while still in college cohen accepted a job at the notorious trading firm gruntal first job was at a small not terribly well-respected brokerage firm it was called gruntal and company and it was located in right close to the actual wall street in lower manhattan you know it was the place where there were a lot of misfits it wasn't sort of a slick establishment corporate environment it was it was a little bit wild and a lot of what was going on there consisted of brokers calling kind of individual investors trying to sell them sell them on different stock investments but uh steve was hired by a family friend who was also from great neck who had started an options arbitrage desk at gruntal brand new on the job cohen is already confident enough in his abilities as a trader making both predictions about stocks he's working for ronald eiser who specializes in options arbitrage the mathematically inclined iser was suspicious that anyone can make any predictions of stock price but he decides to give cohen some money to make his first trade to a surprise colin made four thousand dollars in one day and another four thousand dollars overnight in 1978 this was some meaningful profit now cohen is what's called an intuitive trader honestly what he does is no different from gambling he has a sense of risk and reward it is strange but he seemed to have this gut feeling about a stock market and he's more often right than wrong well so people used to describe him as a tape reader and it's a bit of a strange thing i mean it basically meant you know before uh the whole trading mechanism was electronic there was a physical ticker tape and you could sit there and look at orders coming in and out of the market and he was according to people who worked with him very very good at this he could sort of scan the market he could look at all the available news and information about a particular stock and then he could just sit there in front of his screens and make a lot of money trading almost like what we think of as day trading now so it was a certain amount of natural talent and intuition it was obvious to eiser that cohen is the most talented trader he has ever seen during the mid 1980s the american stock market was dominated by mergers and acquisitions cohen was making 10 million dollars a year by building positions around events such as takeovers and ipos i think there's some beginners luck to it just like playing poker doesn't matter how many hands you have won you can lose everything in one bad bet the dow dropped more than 22 almost double the rate of the black monday that signaled the beginning of the crash of 1929 but this crash of 1987 is not just an american experience around the world stock markets fell faster than a skydiver without a parachute [Music] where regan took over the presidency american economy saw some of the biggest growth in decades the finance industry was prospering attracting hundreds of thousands of young men to partake in the market steep coe grew up poor but through years of hustling he became the start trader at a trading firm called gruntal during this boat market steve cohen was breaking more profits than anyone but little did he know a financial bomb is about to explode economic growth has slowed while inflation was still high the strong dollar was putting pressure on exports the valuations for stocks have gone up to excessive levels with overall p e ratios above 20 future estimates for earnings were lower but stocks were unaffected all these conditions created a perfect storm the black monday stock market crash of october 1978 saw u.s markets fall 20 percent in a single day [Music] qurantel along with many other firms was practically put out of business cohen's group lost almost half his capital every one of the seven traders was nearly wiped out by losses we see blow-ups like this all the time sure some traders might have some skills at predicting a stock but once in a while a market can change fundamentally and when that happens you lose everything [Music] a really great trader what he does is he smells the beer and what he does is he organizes himself to be able to take advantage of others fears okay and ultimately what happens there is he's disciplined he's not acting from statistical analysis he sees that as something but what he's developed is an intuitive intuition of being able to see the supply and demand and he knows the blood there and he knows where they're trapped that's state of mind management as the chaos continued around him he stayed in the game actively trading to recoup losses he ultimately survived the crash but cohen grew tired of gruntl he wanted to start his own shop instead with the hedge fund structure cohen has the potential of making more money with less restrictions in 1993 cohen started sac with around 23 million dollars in capital and nine employees he put in about 10 million dollars of his own money and his traders and friends investors put in the rest although cohen's trading strategy is hard to emulate there are some essential principles it always follows [Music] taking the lessons from playing poker cohen believed that investing is all about smart risk-taking and he was very good at managing risk he didn't get emotionally attached to his trades he was very good about sort of pulling the plug and selling something if it just started to go against you and you know the kinds of situations where a lot of people will end up just losing more and more money because they don't want to acknowledge that they made a mistake he he was according to everyone who worked with him at the time he was very good at just being dispassionate and analyzing risk in this very cool detached way and he just started to make um you know a lot of money millions of dollars very quickly within three years sec had quadrupled in size to almost 100 million dollars cohen started buying mentions and expensive arts he may be on top of the world but he fails to see there's a crisis [Music] looming the late 90s and early 2000s saw the biggest growth of hedge funds by 2012 there were more hedge funds than public companies right at the top of the hedge fund kingdom was sac one of the most profitable shops ever born and raised in a middle class family steve cohen built scc capital from scratch making billions in the process the success of sec draws admiration and envies for wall street and also from places cohen didn't expect [Music] anyone working at any hedge fund uh who involved in short-term trading meaning every day they're coming and trading in and out of stocks all of those people want edge that is a common term in the industry they want edge and you know there's this white edge it's kind of useless for their purposes there's the gray zone and then there's black edge which is clearly inside information since the event of internet information has become widely accessible making it tougher to beat the market now a great majority of the academics believe that it is impossible to ever outperform the market those that seem to do well are just lucky in other words the market is highly efficient prices basically reflect all available information so that in a strict view of the theory it would say it's basically impossible to beat them beat the market you're always paying a fair price basically i think there's a merit to the argument that it is a virtually impossible to beat the market i think some of these hedge fund managers know that that is why they're looking for an information that gives them the edge and unsurprisingly many of them resort to insider trading one hedge fund manager raj raja rotten realized that as well the only way to beat the market is through cheating prosecutors want the toughest punishment possible for this man the convicted founder of the galleon hedge fund raj rajaratnam in 2010 billionaire hedge fund manager raj rajaratnam was sentenced 15 years in jail for insider trading but soon the prosecutors realized he is just a small fish and there are bigger sharks to catch by 2008 sac managed 14 billion dollars in equity at recovering from the housing recession and growing faster than before in that year sac portfolio manager matthew martoma started building large positions on two pharmaceutical companies elon and wyeth who were developing promising drug trials for alzheimer's there were several analysts and traders who felt very bearish on ilan and wyeth and they could not understand why martoma and cohen were building up these pretty substantial unhedged positions and cohen would say well martoma knows a lot about this it turned out martoma's information came from a special source dr sidney giltman who was affiliated with the company the two drug companies were scheduled to announce the final results of the trial on july 28 2008 in chicago but through dr sidney gilman murtoma knew the trial was a disappointment scc started to aggressively unwind its large positions in elon and wyeth and in fact ended up going short those two stocks to make bet against them the shared price fell through a cliff in the meantime cohen made 276 million dollars betting against the two companies while enjoying this incredible profit steve cohen did not realize that this is the beginning of his downfall martoma was convicted 2014 as what federal prosecutor claimed as the most profitable insider trading conspiracy in history at the same time the sec brought charges against a number of other sac employees before long call himself was charged by the sec for his failure to supervise his employees cohen settled his civil case with the regulators in january 2016 and was banned for managing outside money until 2018. fortunately to cohen with the help of his team of prestigious lawyers cohen himself was able to avoid any criminal indictment this is a devastating blow but cohen refuses to give up he now must look for a new edge one allows him to continue to make great profits by 2014 sac closed his door and converted to 0.72 a family office and so the ability to have your own family office controlling your investments controlling your cash flow without every other big firm knowing about it is very important i think that's a lot of the reason you're seeing more and more of them start up essentially cohen gets to run his hedge funds made out of his own money he also realizes that he could stake other hedge funds wrong by his former employees [Music] majority of the return is from the investment at melvin capital that made 47 percent in 2020. without the black gas enabled by insider trading 0.72 has not been able to make large returns like what sac used to his only hope is allocating his money to other hedge funds who may possess the black edge known for his audacious bets and crazy returns gabe plotkin was a superstar portfolio manager at sec with mr plotkin it seems like really really strong stock picking um he's had experience managing money for a long period of time he was at um at sac and then .72 since 2006. gate plotkin has been consistently outperforming the market over the past years reminiscent of og steve cohen but neither cohen nor plotkin could anticipate a group of amateur traders from reddit will bring them down to their knees [Music] hedge funds are raking billions for their wealthy investors at the forefront of this growth was steve cohen who single-handedly turned a small-time fund into a 50 billion empire almost doubling every year it turned out his secret was insider trading after being dismantled by the authorities steve cohen is forced to think of new ways to make money point 72 the new firm confounded started to make height returns after allocating to other hedge funds started by his students point 72 was regaining its past glory but cohen's newfound success will soon be challenged by the most unlikely group of people on january 22 2021 approximately 140 percent gamestop public shares have been so short with such a large amount of shares being shorted they could trigger a short squeeze that the stock market will be brought down by the wild actions and stocks like gamestop that's that retailer place game you go in you buy video games you know you buy the hardware uh this gamestop is really something we must talk about because it's been bit up higher and higher by enthusiastic traders by the end of january 2021 melvin capital had a loss of 53 of his investments now struggling for life cohen partnered up with a citadel putting 2.75 billion dollars to bail out melvin capital both hedge funds lost a lot of money during this incident it was like the high tower surprise to all hedge funds it is safe to say that 0.72 has lost its edge recent years colton has expanded his investment into venture capital quan strategies and so on this is all in search for new alpha but with the regulators constantly watching them at a negative public sentiment against hedge funds cohen has essentially retired from the active role follow your passion um it's not all about money right the money comes from success comes from being passionate about something and then doing it the best of your ability whatever it is [Music] [Music] you"

options were limited for belle groves after a near fatal car accident the 22 year old belt grove spent almost entire year in the hospital to pass the time he started reading about the art of gambling then he came across a book written by mathematician edward thorpe it's called beat the dealer his book showed how you can beat the casinos at the game of blackjack he read the book cover the cover it became his holy bible gross feels strongly that it is possible to get rich by gambling the objective card counting is to tell the player whether he's got the advantage or whether the casino has the advantage if the player has the advantage then he makes a big bet if the casino has the advantage the player makes a small bet so the player wins the majority of big bets and he loses the majority of small bats typically but comes out ahead in the long run to most people getting rich by gambling is a fruitless endeavor but not to bill gross he feels a sense of confidence backed by kind of a mathematical certainty methodically gross turned his initial 200 stake into ten thousand dollars within six months enough to pay for his mba tuition at the ucla [Music] perhaps mostly well-known bond investor belle gross really is in a league of his own spilled pimco from the ground up into the world's biggest bonfire yeah well he's beating 90 of the maynard chapter he's so large that in some ways he creates his own reality at this point his court portfolios has risen at an average analyze rate of 10.6 percent since 1973. think about that for a second his returns are comparable to that of a stock market index but bill gross had a only three negative years with average returns of 2.3 percent but a stock market can go down as much as 23 percent [Music] not knowing it at the time belt groves was born with the asperger's syndrome i'm an asperger and aspergers can compartmentalize they can operate in different universes without the other universes affecting them as [Music] much as i've understood it it in in my uh experience it's allowed me to stay at 30 000 feet as opposed to be on the ground i think it yeah i think it was very important because it allowed me to take what we call the secular approach at pimco the long-term view and it was it was a good view to take as an asperger now if if i was a quantitative traitor hedge fund manager day to day minute to minute boom not so good maybe because of asperger's school was easy for grills he was accepted to duke university one of the most prestigious schools in america hoping to learn more about his own mind he chose a psychology major but in a cruel turn of event just before he graduates a severe accident flips his life upside down [Music] in his senior year at duke university the 22 year old girls was involved in a near fatal car accident when his nash rambler skated head-on into traffic on an icy road he was thrown through the windshield and three quarters of his scalp was sliced off he spent the rest of a semester in hospital receiving multiple skin grafts and treatment for collapsed lawn to pass the time during recovery the mathematically inclined girls started reading a book called beat the dealer that purported to have a new system for blackjack players grows like the argument that consistently placing smaller bats with an edge will lead to a maximum return in the long run you know ran a foul of my old blackjack maxim that said you can never bet more than two percent of your of your steak within six months he turns the initial two hundred dollar stake into ten thousand dollars a considerable amount of money in the late 1960s it was then in there gross knew his future was with business in particular he wanted to try his gambling skills in a different kind of casino the financial market but just before he was ready to pursue his mba with the money he earned tragedy struck again his best friend from college almost a brother to him was killed during the vietnam war this evening i came here to speak to you about vietnam to honor the memory of his fallen friend gross decided he will voluntarily join the military in spite of the fact that he wasn't drafted for the next three years bill gross was sent to the deep trenches of the vietnam war serving as assistant chief engineer abroad the uss diazenko transporting navy seals to landing sites along the coast of vietnam he left the navy in 1970 with a tech combat and vietnam active service ribbons as he originally intended he enrolled in the ucla's mba program the 1973 oil crisis paralyzed the u.s economy the crisis has shattered business confidence wall street has slumped economists are forecasting the biggest recession since the great depression the 1970s saw some of the highest rates of inflation in the united states as a result the performance of fixed income investments was entering the worst phase in decades i had a friend who was a bond trader at merrill lynch in the 1970s need a job as a trained conductor at night because he had three kids and couldn't support them and what a bond trader made while was clearly not the best time to become a bone trader gross felt he could bring his unique insight as a gambler to the business of bond trading i go well i go you know mom i guess i just said mom but dad was there too i said you know mom i'm going to be the best portfolio manager in the world and they looked at me like i was from mars but somehow i knew that was my goal i didn't know what was going to happen but that was my goal in 1971 bel groves was hired as a junior bond analyst for pacific mutual insurance company when growth started at pacific mutual in 1971 bondsmen really traded at that time they were kind of captain vaults but because of inflation being so high it was almost impossible to make any real returns on bonds but girls had a solution active trading the idea of actively treating the bonds on a daily basis sounds risky especially in the 70s but girls argues that by doing so they could anticipate broad swings and inflation and also have the option to hatch the risk you know we got in early we got into financial futures very early in the early 80s when people uh and clients thought that you know treasury bonds and treasury bill futures were akin to soybeans the treasury futures versus treasuries was was sort of a riskless arbitrage and so we got there early and there was a lot of alpha generated from that not necessarily from brilliant long-term interest rate call persuaded by a strong argument his boss at pacific mutual agreed to given 15 million dollars to form a bond portfolio by the end of 1970s pacific investment management co aka pimco was born to give an idea how crazy this sounds it's almost like asking your parents savings to date trade them although it seems risky to normal people bill grills had a different idea of risk backed by sound mathematics girls believes strongly that as long as he follows the gambling principles his portfolio will always be okay first for every bet there must be an edge meaning 51 chance of being right secondly each bet must be properly sized this means placing small bets on less certain situations and bigger bets on more certain situations bet sizing is perhaps most important concept in gambling but it is often overlooked by traders in finance it's the only important question basically what what are your bad sizes so like all you know about poker goes through your head when you're picking your bad sizes it all sounds good in theory but none of that matters if a growth fails to deliver in the real world since the bonds were really heavily traded the market was relatively eliquid pimko became one of the earliest active bond traders building and selling various positions such as mortgage-backed securities tips bond futures and convertibles in the early 80s when people uh and clients thought that uh you know treasury bonds and treasury bill futures were akin to soybeans you know you had to go out with chris dialis and i went out with a t-shirt said you know the wave of the future but the client said uh is this like uh soybeans or are you trading corn um but the spreads were enormous in terms of value and on and on and on with tips and with global bonds we got in early just like gambling gross was playing a zero sum game when the rest of the market didn't know the game existed four years later his bum portfolio grew to 40 million dollars the strategy paid off in 1975 a year which passive bond holders struggled girls turning a 17.6 game followed by nearly 18 in 1976 [Music] over the next three decades he continued to outperform the fixed income world with an array of unique trading strategies by the end of 1999 pip go grow to three billion dollars at the same time bell girls saw a huge financial bubble actualizing he warned in his monthly investment column that a dot-com bubble would soon burst but few listened but girls couldn't care less it is because he understands a crash in a stock market can be a good news for the fixed income market that same year he and his partner sold pimco to alliance for 3.3 billion dollars he received 233 million dollars for his stake an alliance also agreed to pay him 40 million dollars in retention bonuses now rich as ever belle gross enjoys living a lifestyle of luxury according to the wall street journal gross bought a house in southern california's famed newport beach with the intent of demolishing it the paper says he then intends to build a new one although belle groves relishes his immense wealth and inflated lifestyle he's still grounded in the reality of the market one morning in 2005 while standing on his head he saw a vision the collapse of the u.s housing market pimko is in southern california bill girls discovered that housing prices around that area was climbing into the stratosphere the fact that someone in modesto california would buy a home for 500 000 that had sold 24 months before at 250 you know what was simply a mistake as were the dot coms as were you know many stocks and as were many uh levered bonds uh and bond structures by the way uh simply 12 to 24 months ago the subprime's been the prime example so to speak at 500 a ticket they've come to hear how to buy their very own piece of the american dream he wonders is this happening all around the country pimco dispatched 11 mortgage analysts to 20 cities to find out they posed as a prospective home buyers and drove around with unsuspecting real estate agents and mortgage brokers who told them how easily they could get a home loan in an october 2005 letter to investors he made one of the most precinct calls of the last decade warning of the looming subprime mortgage crisis but everyone ignored him again what is the worst case scenario if in fact we were to see prices come down substantially across the country well i guess i don't buy your premise it's a pretty unlikely possibility we've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide a nationwide basis while wall street was losing big pimco's total return fund was at 4.3 percent in 2008. pimco avoided the entire subprime crisis and you know our 2008 numbers relative to everybody else were more than outstanding and you know set the stage really for the next 10 years however the possibility of a total collapse of the entire financial system was still imminent the u.s government was desperately trying to put out the fire they wanted to bail out the banks without creating a moral hazard a moral hazard happens when someone takes bigger risks because he knows he's going to get bailed out instead the officials come to build girls for help asking him to bail out the banks together as republican nationalizing banks goes against everything bell girls stands for but as a bond speculator this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to make huge profits bell girls negotiated a deal with a government that is almost risk-free and guaranteed a 25 return at the end of 2009 he had invested 61 percent of funds money in mortgage bonds what makes this investment almost risk-free is that if things go south the government is responsible for repaying all the debts on pinko's behalf [Music] following the collapse of wall street in 2008 gross emerged as one of the nation's most influential financiers year by year under the leadership of bill grills pimco kept growing having trillions of dollars under management making bill grill's billions in personal fortune as well he is literally the bond king and when you're the king everyone wants your throne in a surprise move pimco's bill gross has left the company he founded more than four decades ago gross built pimco from the ground up into the world's biggest fur his departure capsicum of turmoil at the company in which it was riven by destructive tensions at the top due to a power struggle in 2014 belle groves was kicked out by the very company he founded so the executive committee and alliance at some point said uh you know this guy has got to go so so the lesson they're in is is that is the not to pack the executive committee or pack the supreme court but to make sure you have some friends on it i didn't have a i didn't have a single supporter on there furious bill grills sued pimco and received 81 million dollars payment at that same year bill gross joe and pimco's vegas competitor janice henderson to manage janice henderson's global unconstrained bond funds in many ways this is a classic bill gross move i mean this guy is not interested in leaving and uh it's sort of quietly going away he had something to prove but in 2019 at the age of 74 bill gross officially retired from active fund management [Music] you"

    "content": "i put the television on uh it was left on cnbc evidently i was eating my dinner on a tray and and then i came up and i was looking at myself i was completely exhausted and i said this is like surreal we were on almost the whole day it was blackstone day on television and it ended up being the second largest ipo of the decade [Music] [Music] ultimately all journeys are alone it's great to have support you go forward and say your job is to make something work and that's your number one priority to make it work you know it's like super human effort people don't come become successful as part-time workers it doesn't work that way steve schwartzman was called the king of wall street i think it's fitting not because the business is so big and influential but because he built it from the ground up in 1985 the internal power struggle at lehman brothers forced stephen schwarzman to leave the company as a senior partner when lehman brothers was blowing up i saw a lot of behavior that i didn't like and i didn't want to be with the people while still in his 30s schwartzman has made enough money to retire for life but that is not the life he wanted ever since he was a child schwartzman always tried to do the impossible you have to a dream and imagine a perfect vision of what you want to be creating uh and then you have to live in that world before it exists now he dreams of building his own financial empire bigger than lehman brothers his dream seems impossible but schwarzman has been beating the odds his entire life after world war ii philadelphia was teaming with business opportunities even as a teenager schwartzman was immersed in the world of business by working for his family's furniture store which has made them very wealthy when i was 14 i had started working at my dad's retail store it was looks a little like a bed bath and beyond except there was no bed bath and beyond this is when his ambition started to show he wanted his family to take the furniture store and build it to become a national brand like bed bath and beyond when i was 14 i said to my dad hey dad why why don't we take this thing national and he looked at me and he said i don't think that's a good idea i said dad why don't you want to do this this is going to be really successful he said i'm i'm a happy person he said he said the store makes enough money i can send you and your brothers to college i really don't aspire to uh so i i've always been motivated by seeing something that you know doesn't exist but seeing the opportunity and and realizing on it making it as wonderful as it could be there's just something that you know is is part of my dna that when i see something that works the first thing i say is how big can it be how powerful is this idea not only did schwartzman excel academically but he was also part of the track and field team in his high school that eventually won the state championship i was an athlete uh all my life and in in high school uh you know i did a few sports including uh track and field i was a sprinter uh our team won the state championship you know we sort of traveled around the country we were i think fourth in the aau championships we were pretty hot steve schwartzman is a soft-spoken guy you know seemed very personable but he's also very competitive i think this athletic experience has shaped his personality making him always want to be number one [Music] however steve schwartzman's outstanding performance in classrooms could not get him into his dream college [Music] harvard a result in 1965 he became a freshman at yale university but steve schwartzman had a rough start at yale feeling isolated he decided he should do something extraordinary to impress everyone around that time there was no girls at his school he then comes up with the idea to bring ballerinas to perform for yale's man steve schwartzman's bolt actions got him noticed by a mysterious group of people a yale skull and bones impressed by his abilities this exclusive club invited him to become a member one thing is certain a secret society is about elevating members above others us versus them in the ivy league secret societies are the elite among the elite and members often become world leaders armed with a prestigious degree and invaluable social connections steve schwarzman knows it is only a matter of time until he reaches the top of the world but he soon found out the real world was much tougher than he thought [Music] in the late 70s the investment banking industry started to grow rapidly i had a friend who was a bond trader at merrill lynch in the 1970s he had a job as a trained conductor at night because he had three kids and couldn't support them on what a bond trader made by 1986 he was making millions of dollars this growth attracted a lot of ambitious young men to join the industry among them was steve schwartzman who took on a job at lehman brothers which was the star of the investment banking industry at the time investment banks are not really banks they raise money for companies in the event of a merger acquisition or going public [Music] he said i got your paper there's a typo on page 43 bang and i had really like struggled what kind of crazy world am i in what is this about steve schwartzman quickly adapted to the high moving culture on wall street and excelled at his job in a few short years he raised a better part of 100 million dollars for his clients but his real break comes when he orchestrated a deal worth 488 million dollars remember homemade orange juice things back now remember all those fresh juicy bits of orange dancing in your class on your tongue introducing new propaganda home style orange juice started as a family company tropicana became one of the most well-known juice brands when the company was offered to be acquired the owners failed it was time to cash out steve schwartzman successfully made the deal happen which secured him the partner status at lehman brothers at the tender age of 35. as i say it was the second biggest deal in the world and i wasn't a partner i was just sort of a worker so that was sort of i guess what you'd say was a a bit of a breakout moment for me what is next becoming a ceo of the most powerful investment bank is not just a dream anymore steve schwartzman feels he's on the trajectory to become a titan on wall street but to his dismay in just over a few years he was forced to leave lehman brothers louis glucksman was a hard-hitting trader who was known to throw his phone at a wall when provoked after he became the ceo of lehman the culture started to become increasingly toxic lehman ran into a lot of trouble as a result of a change in ceo uh my former partner pete peterson was forced out of the firm uh and blue blacksmith was put in and through a variety of decisions that turned out to be unfortunate the firm found itself in a situation with a giant uh trading position that went wrong uh the net worth of the firm basically marked a market with zero it's just a question whether somebody would figure it out if they did uh you know that comes to a very violent ending in finance seeing that no one was willing to do what was necessary steve schwartzman started a coupe he then successfully ousted glocksman and sold lehman brothers to american express and exited the company with millions of dollars to his name i was asked to sell the firm in two or three days which i did i was quite happy doing the kind of work that i was doing but i didn't think that just morally ethically i could be in the same place when you see people under enormous stress doing things that go against your values you basically don't have a choice steve schwarzman is at a crucial point in life when he could just retire and live out the rest of his life as a wealthy businessman or he could start again this time he will build something that was never built before [Music] without hesitation steve schwartzman decided to start his own business with his previous boss pete peterson the only problem is they don't know what businesses start for several months we had breakfast every day at the mayfair region at 66th and park we're the first people there the last to leave and we said what would make us unique what would be different uh because we wanted to to be successful it's better to be different than like everybody else eventually they decided to step into the thriving industry of private equity we came up with a with a good strategic plan to do uh advisory work to pay the rent uh to go into the buyout business because it looked like a pretty uh easy way frankly to make money in the mid 80s steve schwartzman is a risk-averse entrepreneur he wanted to have a steady stream of income first before building the greatest private equity in the world this idea that entrepreneurs are are risk takers is complete bs they're risk takers from the perspective of people who are watching them not from them themselves people who are entrepreneurs just see the the same facts uh differently or they s or they actually obtain different facts putting down 200 000 each they open their business at the sea grand building just north of grand central station both schwarzman and peterson were highly respected professionals in finance possessing wide connections raising capital for their private equity fund should be easy for them at least that's what they thought we sent 600 letters out to people announced our our new business and i expected the firm phone to be ringing so i don't know how often you like to be rejected but try it that many times my math skills aren't that good but it's got to be somewhere around 350 something 450 something rejections fortunately there was enough cash flow from their consulting business to keep them going more determined than ever steve schwartzman vowed that he would never stop until he raises one billion dollars for his company raising capital is a confidence game don't overestimate how smart these investors are because sometimes they exhibit hurt behavior i think that is why bernie madoff was able to raise so much money from these so-called sophisticated investors after endured countless rejections steve schwartzman finally raised 100 million dollars from an insurance company prudential they're with their chief investment officer uh garnett keith i'd never met him before you know i was doing my presentation of private equity fund and and you know getting a piece of our fees from our m a business so we're starting a merchant bank and he looks over to me and he says that's very interesting why don't you put me down for a hundred million dollars and i couldn't believe what i was hearing because at that time the prudential was the largest investor and the most prestigious investor in the world in private equity and 100 million in 1986 for a fund that was first time funded two people never made an investment this was like getting 500 million dollars once the first investor put down 100 million dollars it instills a great deal of confidence to other potential investors we ended up raising the biggest first-time fund in history with two people who'd never made an investment just by force of will so it does show you that force of will counts it counts with that willpower they raise a total of 1 billion dollars to start blackstone trusted with such a large amount of money steve schwarzman knows failure is not an option his first investment is going to be the deal breaker his years of experience has shown him that high risks don't always equal to height rewards he wanted height rewards without the risk right away he found a great company to buy u.s steel was the company created in 1901 by j.p morgan when he bought the carnegie steel from andrew carnegie steel production was vulnerable to the sharp rices and falls in commodity prices and fluctuating demand from customers by 1987 a labor struct paralyzed its plants and carl icahn a corporator has bought enough shears to launch a proxy action for hostile takeover to raise the great mail money they plan to sell the railroads and barges divesting them into a separate company this potential new company is a great candidate for a leveraged buyout to make an lbo work blackstone has to borrow a large amount of money to finance the deal since they were a new player in town no major banks would want to lend them money but there was one bank that decided to take a bet with blackstone new york has always had more different kinds of people than any place else but they have one similarity they all think there aren't enough hours in the day that's why in 1969 chemical introduced the first cash machine and now we've brought 24-hour banking home with people you can call anytime any day it turned out to be the best thing to happen to blackstone this chemical bank will later grow to be an unstoppable force in finance eventually devouring banks like chase manhattan [Music] subsequently blackstone put in 13.4 million dollars in equity while borrowed 636 636.6 million dollars from chemical banks and the bunk market blackstone's first deal turned out to be a great success as predicted the steel market recovered and the transport business was booming blackstone's investment improved the company's cash flow and in four years their equity quadrupled by the time they sold the business in 2003 this one investment achieved an annualized return of 130 percent however finance is a fragile business one mistake can spell the end edgecomb based in philadelphia another steel plant manufactures parts for cars trucks and airplanes [Music] once again steve schwartzman made a boat bed in the company with around 300 million dollars a month after deal was closed the steel prize started tumbling down and edgecomb was imploding this was truly terrible this was our third deal and you know i had one of our partners we had no processes i had never made an investment before one partner thought this deal was a good thing and another one heard we were looking at it and he came in to see me and he said it was going to go bankrupt because it was just making inventory profits disguised as real profits and that when steel's steel distribution business when steel prices went down as much as we were earning we would lose that more uh on the way down and the company would go bankrupt so and within six months we couldn't pay our interest on the debt and ultimately we lost all of our money and this was this was beyond dramatic i don't like failure i'm not used to it we all have it humiliated steve schwartzman vows to never make the same mistakes again he was going to build a robust decision-making system that prevents failures like this this is not a normal thing and what we do when we fail is we spend enormous time thinking through what did we do wrong you know failure is a how you manage failure is very important and some people manage failure by making pretend it didn't happen and they just go about their jobs and people don't pay attention oh we lost money on that one i don't believe in that i i like to learn after that blackstone rarely had an investment that lost money there's an argument saying that finance doesn't really create value it's just people exchanging money but i do believe that blackstone genuinely created value for the companies by offering capitals expertise talents or management the incredible track record has fueled the unstoppable growth of blackstone to get even more prominent they decided to expand into the real estate market however by 2006 steve schwartzman sensed a storm is coming goldman sachs stearns lehman brothers merrill lynch were all in on this the subprime lending alone increased from 30 billion a year in funding to over 600 billion a year blackstone was among the participants of this real estate boom but they had an insight that put in one step ahead of the market public companies containing lots of real estate properties were frequently valued at less than some of their parts blackstone could take their real estates off their hands fix them up and resell to other buyers by this time blackstone has established itself as a force to fear in a private equity business with size comes competition while eyeing his next game-changing real estate deal steve schwartzman realized he must act quicker than before because there are more competitions now equityoffice was a real estate investment company that owns hundreds of office properties comprising tens and millions of square feet on november 2nd 2006 they offered a premium of 8.5 percent over the market price and eop opened their books to blackstone this move attracted a bunch of competitors in the industry to join the bid not willing to lost the bid steve schwartzman raised their offer to nine percent at 52 a share to his surprise vornado a real estate investment company outbided blackstone schwarzman was furious and raised his bid to 55.5 dollars 24 higher than a market price and that is their final offer which is all cash while his main competitor vornado offered part cash and part stock this has sealed the deal for blackstone they won what steve schwartzman did next shocked everyone realizing that he may have overpaid putting his investment at a risky level schwarzman decided he will sell half the company to take media profit since we were a market top for real estate so just buying 39 billion dollars of real estate i i thought was dangerous uh because you had to pay a pretty good price to get it because it was competitive so as as soon as we decided we were going to actually raise our price enough to be be the winner there were two or three of us sitting around saying this deal is potentially dangerous we've got to reduce the leverage and we've got to take advantage of the crazy prices that people are paying so we decided to sell half of what we bought the same day we bought it so when i told people that they just sort of looked at me and and said the same day i said i don't want to take any risk closing the largest real estate deal steve schwartzman turned 60 years old in 2006. however instead of thinking about retirement steve schwartzman was thinking about his next big move by 2007 the market was still hot but schwartzman sensed there's a storm coming maybe there's still a chance for a massive expansion of assets before the storm hits that is to go public on july 24 2007 blackstone raised seven billion dollars the second largest ipo after google by 2021 at the age of 74 steve schwartzman is still the chairman and ceo of the blackstone group which is now more massive than what lehman ever was steve schwartzman he's the new king of the world right leonardo craft beer will play him in the movie report today says they have 78.7 billion under management mr schwartzman's firm has had a return on private equity investments of 23 percent a year for the last on average for the last 20 years in the real estate group at blackstone they've had 30 a year for the last 15 years and this is after keys once anybody decides to do something particularly with their life um it's it's a must do i mean you you can't fail and you try and think really carefully before you do something and if it's well conceived then it's not working it just means you have to move it around or you know maybe you're too early the world isn't ready for you and so you just suck it up and go back again and you can never give up once you make that commitment [Music] [Music] you"

    "content": "meet kane gao an mit graduate who's ready to start his quan hedge fund he's convinced his models will make a killing in the market [Music] that is because he has stolen these models from two sigma a well-known quantum hedge fund in the world after quitting two sigma two months ago gout hacked into their system and grabbed their secretive quantitative trading models these models have made two sigma billions of dollars now in the hands of gal he will use them to print money literally [Music] funded in 2001 two sigma has become the very top fund in the world whose performance is in the same league as renaissance technologies and e shawl today through the use of algorithms with its unique culture the firm manages over 52 billion dollars in assets with more than 1400 employees across offices in new york hong kong and tokyo what are those models and more importantly why are they so protected by two sigma [Music] so inside this pizza hut was the hedge fund legend paul tudor jones in there he was having a confidential meeting with the managing director of d.e shaw john overdeck together they envisioned a new type of quantum fund that can compete head on with rintec and d.e shaw without hesitation tudor jones decided to provide a generous seat capital for the new hedge fund they also invited david siegel who was the chief information officer at tutors investment corporation to join the team of this potentially groundbreaking hedge fund tudor jones has strong confidence in both of them confidence backed by their impressive resumes the financial market is known to attract gamblers and risk takers but it also attracts nerds who have a strong desire to make sense of this complex system these math wizards try to understand the market by making a lot of money john overdeck is a stanford educated mathematician who was working alongside jeff bezos at d.e shaw and yes that jeff bezos who runs a little company called amazon siegel is just as impressive he holds an artificial intelligence phd from mit and built a successful fintech company sold to merrill lynch after that he became the chief technology officer at tutors investment corporation the financial market is a highly complex game where even quants with phds often failed miserably [Music] well you know our vision is really to focus on the capabilities of data science and we think of investing as a data science problem from day one they decided to differ themselves from other hedge funds they considered two sigma to be a tech startup whose mission is to build technologies to extract signals in the financial market we think that by incorporating more and more information on the world into making investment decisions we can do a better job you know this is nothing really in a way a new idea investors of all ages have wanted to use data in making their investment decisions no no investor would say that they're just you know waking up in the morning and randomly picking something to invest in but the ability to basically incorporate huge information uh occurring around the world into every single investment decision that you make that's only possible by using these advanced data science methods and i think that you know even in the field of investing we're still in the early days of what these kinds of methods can do over the i can see go know the first year's performance is going to mean the life and death of their new company over that and segal come to resolution that they should start with equities because they're the most liquid and have the most data to build their models on day one they rolled out dozens of models for an equity market neutral strategy exploiting hundreds of short-term patterns in the market it was an instant success making them double-digit returns in its first year at the same time the market was crushed by the dot-com bubble the markets are incredibly difficult to predict so these quants do look for models but most of the models have only a very tiny edge even if you have a bet that works 51 of the time by law of large numbers that is a good model and it is still generating alpha well if you go to a casino you probably know that casinos overall make more money than they lose to the players finding an edge in the market to me matt finding a way to do better than investing in index funds while their models do the most of the work printing them money two sigma spend majority of the time developing new models in 2004 two sigma launched eclipse a set of models for a macro strategy starting to trade futures and foreign exchange the problem with quant funds is that these patterns die out what always end up happening to two sigma and many other coin funds is that they have to constantly look for more patterns or the return will suffer unlike d e shawl or rintag who have a short holding period of two days on average in 2004 the firm also started spectrum a fund for a longer holding period this new fund cleared pathway to a more scalable asset management business tu sigma then launched a fund called absolute return in 2011 which had an even longer holding period there has been a funny trend in the world of hedge fund a lot of traditional funds started to use more statistical methods and styles while at the same time some quan funds started to do more traditional fundamental trading for example the majority business for citadel and de shaw is now just old-fashioned stop picking this trend is called the quantum mental style there is a lot of interest these days for what i call quantum mental firms two sigma was ahead of its time using quantum mental approach to investing which has only recently become popular one way is combine to add a machine learning layer to your traditional fundamental decision making suppose that you have you work for a firm that is very fundamental where people make decisions based on either book information accounting or traditional economic models and now um what you would like to do is not to challenge the decisions made by those models but what you would like to do is to determine what is the betting size how much should we bet on these forecasts made by the fundamental model even with the smartest brains and the most powerful computers they couldn't predict the madness of the market in 2008. back everyone our next guest is an internationally known expert on quantitative finance who warns that the banks should not trust their mathematical models basically he called this crisis nobody responded well the mathematical models were never perfect and one of the problems though was really that a lot of people working derivatives thought that they were much better than they were than they actually were and there is an incentive built into the system there's a kind of moral hazard that that encourages people to believe in these things because it allows them to trade and trade bigger and bigger and bigger and one of the problems with a lot of risk management techniques for example is they they can be used to hide risk when really they should be alerting you to risk in 2007 stocks plummeted in august sparked by the series of black swan events including the collapse of two bears stern credit funds this also triggered the collapse of quant funds because their models started to fail this in quan's term is called a regime shift regime shifts are large abrupt and persistent structural changes in the financial market however in 2008 the year of the financial crisis two sigma's funds finished in high single digits while most hedge funds lost money but his investors still panicked altogether thirty percent of two sigma's assets were cashed out siegel and overdag were furious and decided to never

    "content": "at the age of 33 dent low was ready to start his own hedge fund the trouble is he only had three hundred thousand dollars barely enough to cover business fees loeb turned to his family for help trusting his abilities his family and friends invested three million dollars with him this is the beginning of third point one of the best performing hedge funds in america [Music] dent low was born in santa monica california in a well-connected family his great aunt was the inventor of the famous barbie doll raised by greatly educated jewish parents it was inevitable that loeb will receive the best education as well after enrolled in uc berkeley lowe became deeply interested in finance but he wanted to be close to the action and there is only one place to go after two years at uc berkeley he transferred to columbia university in new york at columbia lopes started trading stocks in his dorm room eventually making him 120 thousand dollars in profits but before he goes celebrate he lost it all in one bad trade losing that large amount of money in the 80s really had a big impact on dan loeb he realized he cannot trade the stock market like a casino there must be some kind of investing methods that generate consistent returns after graduation he became an analyst at a private equity fund warburg pincus for several years the private equity business allowed dantlope to learn the critical skills of business analysis and valuation i worked at warburg pincus and private equity i always really my real passion was always the stock market i worked at a firm called lay for equity investors in risk arbitrage and learned that craft a few years later his swish job to become a bond trader real trajectory took off when i started on the cell side at a firm called jeffries in 1991 at the beginnings of the distressed debt market the correa dent lobe had was lucrative making him over six figures a year while in his late 20s but he wanted much more he knew he could only get there by starting his own fund i used to just fantasize about starting my fund and how i would name it third point capital third point management third point investing then i scratch it out i do logos like this was like really like a dream of mine to get this thing going in 1995 he made its biggest leap and launched third point with 3.3 million dollars of capital i luckily had a good friend of mine who was a wealthy individual who promised to give me about a million for i didn't have a wealthy family but at least they were in a position you know parents aunts a few other people give me a couple hundred thousand dollars each so that was really the start of third point after making eight percent return in the first month of trading dan lowe was confident that he made the right decision and he soon came to understand that in order to make a name for himself in the hedge fund world he had to perform well both in the bear and the bull market which means producing absolute returns to accomplish that he must find a unique trading strategy to create returns that are uncorrelated to the market he decided to pursue an event-driven strategy you know we're an event-driven shop so a lot of what we're doing is risk arbitrage credit plays things like that so we're i wouldn't say market neutral but we're a little less sensitive so typically certain corporate events can cause short-term volatility in asset price events such as corporate reorganization restructuring merger acquisition and bankruptcy event-driven investors are expert in analyzing these special situations and making use of the missed pricing opportunities in his first seven years third point have made steady double-digit returns by taking advantage of short-term undervalued opportunities my time frame that i look at from an investment portfolio from an investment perspective is more like one or two years soon his stellar returns have caught the attention of large hedge fund investors dentlobe was ready to join the big league [Music] as lope kept creating serious profits more investors invested third point quickly grew to have over 100 million dollars by the end of 1999 as the size of third point grows so is the pressure to find more opportunities [Music] when your phone is small you can be more nimble and your actions don't create a lot of attention dan loeb soon discovered there was money to be made in short selling finding both value plays and shorting fads and fraudulent companies and not before long he found himself in the dawn of a major crisis driven by investments in internet-based companies between 1995 and 2000 the nasdaq market index rose 400 percent it reached a price earning ratio of 200 while the average p e ratio for the stock market has historically been about 15. dan lok knows this is his time to shine so he shorted the entire test sector i never participated in the craziness of the internet bubble but i missed the crash in fact i profited from the crash because at a certain point when i thought things were really breaking we started to short stocks and did very well and that really set the stage for for a third point to raise a lot of capital because when they saw that we made money when the market was falling apart then we attracted a lot of capital by the end of 2000 he beat the market by 26.2 percent over the next few years third point consistently beat the market as the fund grew bigger than ever coming in 2007 third point was going strong date bearing was a company that manufactures testing machinery supplies for the medical diagnostics industry in 2003 the company was in financial distress as a result its bump price was trading significantly below face value dentlobe took a bet on this company believing that a business will recover soon and just as predicted the company did come back making third point six hundred percent profit in his investment but little did lope know in just a few months the biggest financial storm would bring him to his knees over the weekend lehman brothers one of the most venerable and biggest investment banks was forced to declare itself bankrupt another merrill lynch was forced to sell itself today crisis talks around your world financial markets are way down today following dramatic developments the financial crisis brought on the worst year in third points history in september just before lehman brothers collapsed third point had about five billion dollars under management with earnings up four percent for the year it ended the year down 30 percent it was a mess i just thought god i spent 13 years building this business and you know i was i felt like it was just slipping between my fingers the organization was demoralized i had huge overhead then the redemption started coming in so we lost you know a third of our capital uh about 1.4 billion dollars in redemptions at the end of the year so i thought well you know at least i have my health dental quickly discovered although the market was in turmoil it also presented him with a lot of opportunities the ones his fund was most equipped to exploit you know february came along and we felt really good again we were up four percent the market was down 25 percent we made all these smart defensive bets we did what we're supposed to do we protected our capital during a tough time by mid 2009 there was still a lot of uncertainties in the market well i don't see how anything's changed to be honest we still have the same problems that we had before but low was more bullish than ever he felt strongly that a market should only go up from here the turning point for me was citigroup pref common exchange deal citigroup has hundreds of billions of dollars of liabilities it was insolvent for all intents and purposes but they did an interesting transaction where they exchanged preferred stock which was at the bottom of the capital structure into equity they also got a lot of government goodies guaranteeing things but it gave them the capital that combined with their own earnings power made citigroup a financially viable entity going forward he started actively buying bank debts eight months later at the end of 2009 third point was up 45 percent third point survived by 2021 dead lope has a net worth of 3.5 billion dollars and he's not hesitant to spend like a billionaire like many hedge fund billionaires he made most of his money from the feces charge by maintaining an above average returns over the years dentlobe had indeed created above average performance consistently including over 20 profit for 2020. an event-driven strategy is only applicable to those with deep knowledge on how certain companies and industries work it is also inherently speculative lucky to start it when i did with the focus that i had was was looking at parts of the market distressed debt uh special situations like spin-offs demutualizations post-ruric bankruptcies during a period where that was a it was a good strategy to be in now with a large amount of capital at his disposal dentlobe has made a name for himself as an activist investor taking stakes in many well-known brands such as yahoo and nestle a lot of these hedge funds are pursuing what's called alpha the returns above the market to do that you have to have an edge either with unique information or some kind of intervention to the company that create more value over the years dent lobe has gone through many bull and bear markets while great majority of hedge funds have died out third point has prevailed [Music] you"

    "content": "to pay for his tuition david tapper was desperately looking for a way to make money competent in mathematics tapper knew he could become an exceptional trader and soon enough he found a profitable pattern in the late 70s options were relatively new he found that certain option prices are always a bit slow to adjust to the change of their underlying securities temper sees this as a perfect opportunity for an arbitrage with this pattern he was able to generate consistent income to pay for all of his expenses in graduate school [Music] pepper started the firm 26 years ago and is said to have generated 25 percent annualized returns on average since then [Music] growing up in a port family in pittsburgh pennsylvania tapper always wanted to get rich a better life he knew it wasn't going to be handed to him he immersed himself in studying hoping to finish in three years in college in order to save money and while also keeping a part-time job out of all the hedge fund billionaires david tupper really is the one that started from the bottom not only that he suffered a lot of childhood trauma despite these good things about my dad he had a bad side too he was physically abusive to me in my young life there was nothing more terrifying there was no greater adversity but i prayed to god that i would never be the same to my children [Music] after earning an mba degree from carnegie mellon david tapper got a job in the treasury department at ohio's republic steel but the company was in financial trouble these guys are out of work why that's the question you just said why there he was introduced to the junk bond market in early 70s investor michael milken put a wild theory into practice by pioneering a huge market for high-yield bonds aka the junk bonds tepra quickly realized he had a talent for trading junk bonds which eventually helped him land a job at the infamous goldman sachs he made a lot of money for goldman sachs but in a bulk market virtually everyone can do well the real test is how well you can perform during a bear market the law of gravity hit wall street today in financial markets around the world for that matter as stock prices plunged even more than they did on black tuesday of 1929. during the market crash of 1987 virtually all traders lost money at goldman sachs all but david tepper he saw the crash coming and set his entire portfolio as short he made so much money by betting against everybody else goldman sachs has a competitive culture david tupper was not well liked at the firm but when i came up her partner i got shot down and i was incredibly upset finally tupper had enough he started trading aggressively on his own account preparing to make enough money to launch his own fund using his connections and goldman sachs tepper raised 57 million dollars for his new hedge fund appaloosa started my own company 25 years ago in 1993 called appaloosa and ended up doing something that was a lot more fun and made my life better in so many ways as soon as he started his fund opportunity came knocking on the door [Music] in the midst of latin america crisis in early 90s tapper purchased many bank debts in argentina right before the country started to recover as a result the fund made 30 return in 1995. david tumber is different kind of value investor so he's very much like seth clarkman if they find something that is undervalued they will bet really big on it tepper kept making phenomenal returns during his early years until this happened in 1998 the central bank of russia defaulted on this debt sending shockwaves to the world like many investors at the time tepper put hundreds of millions of dollars in russian bonds thinking it was impossible for a country to defuse debt but he was wrong when russia government failed to pay their debt tepper lost 80 million dollars then typer did the unthinkable he realized since the incident the market has become overly pessimistic about russian bonds making them extremely undervalued he will lawn on the same bonds once again by the end of 1990 he gained 61 percent as a result of his bets recouping his previous losses and made much more distressed debt has become a gold mine for contrarian investors like tepper in 2001 tepper generated 67 net return by focusing on distressed bonds but he would invest in anything he thought to be undervalued either for short term or for long term so appaloosa and palomino will do anything he also has made huge profits year by year by investing in under the radar companies such as myron an energy company but none of it compared to the opportunity brought by the financial crisis of 2008. the largest financial disaster in decades in this country like everyone else pepper took a hit in 2008 his fund was down 28 percent but he was enchanted because he saw so many undervalued opportunities he knew his losses were just temporary he was not going to let emotions dictate his trading if your thinking and your emotion is the same as everybody else's then you cannot do the out thinking and what i call the second level thinking which is required to act against the herd the common word is contrarian to sell at high prices which are high because other people are optimistic and buy at low prices which are low because other people are depressed so appaloosa quickly began buying all the common preferred and junior subordinate debt it could get his hands on pay as little as five cents on the dollar for securities of aig bank of america and citigroup as predicted his best paid off bank of america gone up more than 330 percent and citigroup more than 220 percent but the biggest price was aig he made a billion dollars from aig alone [Music] as humans we suffer from various cognitive biases people tend to find patterns that aren't there with robinhood a lot of people are coming into this stock market casino with david tapper it is possible that his success is due to luck but there are two things that he does repeatedly that might be helpful for us to learn he always trades with a large margin of safety and uses no leverage how much leverage not none none none what do you need leverage for when washington mutual was on the verge of bankruptcy temper bought their debt at 50 and 60 cents on the dollar second his strategy was more or less event driven not only the asset had to be undervalued david tupper always tried to figure out why it is undervalued and what events that will happen in the future that will trigger value realization seth clarkman called these events the catalysts which triggered value realization started as a date trader in college with a dream of becoming rich pepper has come a long way building one of the most successful hedge funds in the world

    "content": "[Music] the video game retailer skyrocketed more than 380 percent last week on the back of a reddit fueled effort to squeeze the hedge funds that had sold the stock short [Music] now they don't target just any stocks they go after the ones that are heavily shorted in order to come up with a short squeeze [Music] they'll come up with a thesis all in display and then run them and run them until the shorts have to cover their positions spurring still one more leg higher i think that what you're seeing is um essentially a push back against the establishment in a really important way but take a look at it now since the highs on thursday gamestop stock has lost 81 percent of its value [Music] that's an obvious question isn't it of course short sellers are the bad guys aren't they with a recent game stock craze it became obvious to me that there's misunderstanding about short sellers our economy is composed of many interconnected parts that even the smartest people can never truly understand it but one thing is certain without short sellers our financial system will be much less efficient in this episode we'll go back in time and learn how short selling was first invented we will study all the skillful ways that short sellers like sorrows and ironhorn used to generate returns eventually we may come to understand the important role they play in the financial market [Music] [Music] a fleet of eight ships under captain jacob van neck was the first dutch ships to reach the spice islands of indonesia their prime mission was to import cheaper spices from their colonies the fleet returned within a year and made a whopping 400 profit [Music] this is the beginning of the dutch east india company which was the first publicly traded company in history their largest shareholder was isaac lamar revisionary entrepreneur who made his fortune in the grocery business but after a failed power struggle he was thrown out of the company field by vengeance isaiah lamar set out to destroy the dutch east india company in 1609 he founded a secret company with a purpose to trade in dutch east india company shares lamar saw that the rights of french competitors would cost a shared price to drop he realized there was a way to profit from this he invented short selling just like how you borrow money from the banks you can also borrow stocks from a brokerage firm once you borrow the shares you can sell them to other market participants after a while you buy them back and hopefully at a lower price the difference is the profit you make this is the very first recorded short selling in history the key is to remember that just like cash stocks can be borrowed if someone wants to lend them to you since many mutual funds hold stocks for the long term they're very willing to let them out for a fee in 1929 president herbert hoover blamed the short sellers for the market crash small groups in the business world purpose to profit from depreciation of securities and commodities they are equally condemned by our public and business opinion they are by no means helpful to the nation well if everybody's losing money and there's somebody at that time making a lot of money it's going to be natural to feel a little bit of resentment towards them what many people don't understand is that short sellers can play the role of watch docs in many cases they could expose overvalued or even fraudulent companies you see way more stocks that are dramatically overvalued in your career than you will see stocks that are dramatically undervalued it's the nature of securities markets to occasionally promote various things to the sky so that securities will frequently sell for five or ten times what they're worth and they will very very sell themselves for 20 or 10 percent of what they're worth so therefore you see these much greater discrepancies between price and value when a short seller bet against a stock it always costs a lot of backlash because they make a profit when the stock goes down but they're never the root cause it's always the port fundamentals that eventually lead to the drop of a company's stock price even so a great number of people engage in short selling not to bet against the price but as a way to hedge in 1949 while working for the fortune magazine journalist alfred winslow jones was secretly preparing to launch his own investment company he had a groundbreaking idea he discovered by using short selling he could create what's called a market neutral portfolio he bought as many stocks as is so short so the market impact will be neutralized in the portfolio the value of the portfolio then would not be based on the direction of the market but whether the manager had picked the right stocks joe's chose to take 20 profits as his compensation he avoided regulations by minimizing the number of investors to be under 100 this became the first hedge fund in history in this case short selling was not used to bet against the stock but as a way to hatch or an insurance therefore if we ban short selling it will decrease the ability for many funds to hatch the risk which will no doubt cause a lot of volatility in the market hedge fund became a tool that many wealthy people use to take out risky investments like short selling they bet against the shared price of any companies they deem to be overvalued or fraudulent some even took it further by betting against an entire country when british government decided to raise interest rates in order to stop the pressure on sterling i said to my partner now this is the wrong policy for the british government in the in the long term they cannot sustain this therefore you can sell any amount of sterling because it cannot be maintained so i said go for the jugular go for the kill sorrows was a masterful short seller instead of simply betting against the currency he placed a simultaneous bets on interest rates and securities that will be affected by the currency realignment to pull it off soros short about seven billion dollars worth of sterling at the same time he bought about six billion dollars worth of deutsche mark and some french franc as well soros bought about 500 million dollars worth of british stocks as a parallel play because equities often rise after a currency devaluation he didn't stop there he also bought german and french bonds while shorting those countries equities because of strong credit sorry was able to put down only one billion dollars as a collateral so he was leveraged roughly one to ten which is very risky he must have really believed that he was right as predicted sorrows made one billion dollars for this trade he was called the man who broke the bank of england making him one of the most feared and most hated currency speculators in the world although soros didn't act alone it was not less concerning that a small group of short sellers could literally destroy a country's currency i was only one of many market participants that was selling sterling so i did not really break the bank of england because if there weren't so many other people doing it it wouldn't have happened i can only succeed in making money if i guess the direction of the market right the authorities like to blame the speculators but actually it was their mistake that the speculators recognized that is why as a speculator i was successful because i discovered the mistake of the authorities of course they don't like to admit it while currency is speculating to yield high profits not everyone can do it most investors simply can't get high enough leverage to make a reasonable return most dedicated short sellers just focus on the good old stock picking except they pick bet companies to short the research should be the same the work you do should be the same but you have to basically take your positions in the face of almost always overwhelming uh uh criticism of it from the other side you see look it's not always easy even if you've been doing it for a long time jim channels is one of the most well known short sellers of our time [Music] after earning a degree in economics from yale he became an equity analyst for gale force securities in 1982 and it was there that i sort of stumbled on my first short idea which was baldwin united and bald united shortly after we got involved filed for bankruptcy and was the largest financial bankruptcy in the u.s up until that time and that got me thinking about the whole idea of whether or not there was a business to be made in fundamentally analyzing short ideas after years of working as analysts channels founded kainikos in 1985 with 16 million dollars the hedge fund was designed to focus on short selling his reasoning is pretty solid because he saw that there are more companies that will eventually go bankrupt than becoming successful one of these companies was enron arguably the biggest corporate fraud in history channel was among the first short sellers to successfully predict the fall of aaron corp before it fell for bankruptcy when we started going through the documents just things just started completely jumping off the page of their 10ks and 10 qs not least of which was these odd uh offshore partnerships in which a senior executive of the company was the general partner and they existed to primarily do business with enron we put the position on at about 60 it skyrocketed to 80 in the course in a month or two and then rolled over and then never you know pretty much uh went straight down with a few short rallies in the succeeding 11 months and in the world of short selling you know it probably doesn't get a whole lot easier than that what is difficult about short selling is not necessarily just the analysis it has to do more with psychology and market timing and all i can say is it hasn't been for me it is a very very tough business because of the fact that you face unlimited losses and because of the fact that people that have overvalued stocks very overvalued stocks are frequently on some scale between promoter and crook it should be evident by now that the market is not as efficient but it's still very rare to see everyone to be wrong at the same time but it did happen in 2008 brothers have fallen 12 in the last week accelerated by the critical words of david einhorn at the age of 28 david ironhorn was ready to start his own hedge fund but we felt that the the way the industry is set up there's very low barriers to entry and we felt that even with a small amount of money we could if we could do a good job with it we could make you know a good enough uh income stream that we would have a you know have a satisfactory life but he had no money and no track record it was extremely difficult to raise capital until he realized he had wealthy parents he raised more than half a million dollars from his parents and eventually got to a total of nine hundred thousand dollars as a seat money in 1996 green light capital was born during his early years great light capital made remarkable returns by shorting weak financial firms generally speaking we don't short companies on what we think to be valuation we've always insisted on over-evaluation combined with some kind of deterioration in 2008 such a company was lehman brothers and so i called up and i confronted lehman's management with the various discrepancies and they haven't been able to provide um credible answers so let's go through a couple of those ironhorn was the one of the few subaru ones in a drunken party it turned out to be one of the best trades of all time these short sellers are generally called contrarians they take conventional wisdom and ask what if the opposite is true what if the sun is powered by coals what if tesla is a fraud it is like that mathematical reasoning called proof by contradiction you start by assuming the opposite is true and see if it can arrive at some reasonable conclusion in the case of gamestop there were so many short sellers what if they were wrong [Music] stock picking is perhaps the most common and oldest activity in finance [Music] in the world of stock pickers it is near impossible to distinguish between skills and luck [Music] but once in a while a hedge fund comes along scoring consistent height returns that defies luck steve cohen's sac was one of those hedge funds his secret was insider information allegedly at the end of day to have a real edge as a stock picker it all comes down to information the one that you have that others don't everything else can be pretty much explained by luck known for his audacious bets and crazy returns gate plotkin was a superstar trader at sac well uh with mr plotkin it seems like really really strong stock picking um he's had experience managing money for a long period of time he was at sac and then point 72 since 2006. after sac was dismantled by the regulators kit plot can start his own hedge fund melvin capital with a focus on short selling with one billion dollars asset under management immediately the fund started an astonishing winning streak went to start his own firm so this was this was actually the 47 percent number is particularly impressive because it was his first full year managing money so that you know right off the bat not only did he raise quite a bit of money but he came out with incredible performance i suspect that there's a high expected return for short sellers because the amount of risk they take after many years of exceptional performance it all came crashing down when melvin capital became the target of a short squeeze the stock market will be brought down by the wild actions in stocks late game stock that's that retailer place game you go in you buy video games in the you know you buy the hardware uh this gamestop is really something we must talk about because it's been bid up higher and higher by enthusiastic traders on january 22nd 2021 approximately 140 percent of gamestop's public shares have been so short this means that some of the shortest shares have been rented over and over again in this case the consensus is that gamestop is a bad company what if they were wrong this is a question that many retail investors ask on subreddit wall street bets they believed the company was being significantly undervalued now they've got a community of very rapid investors who will choose individual stocks and then run them up as a group with commentary about how much they love them with such a large amount of shares being shorted they could trigger a short squeeze by driving up the price to the poi where short sellers had to encapsulate and cover their positions as a large loss now i know what it's like to get caught on the wrong side of a short squeeze the only thing a short seller can really do when targeting is to throw in the towel no point in trying to fight it you just have to cover your short meaning buy back the stock to close out position before before you run out of money [Music] the video game retailer skyrocketed more than 380 percent last week on the back of a reddit fueled effort to squeeze the hedge funds that had sold the stock short but on january 28th robin hood put restrictions on gamestop and many similar stocks this action infuriated retail investors and the public i've seen it on twitter already as you point out carl people upset at the idea that they can no longer buy and it will have an impact by the end of january 2021 melvin capital had a loss of 53 of his total investments this is what happens when you're a short seller you face virtually unlimited downside but this type of targeted coordinated attack by the retail investors is unprecedented this incident escalated to a class warfare [Music] by and large the free market system has brought prosperity to the country who practiced it those that tried a different system have all failed in the free market system each participant is incentivized and given the freedom to take risks and make money for themselves this should include short sellers short sellers are the anti-heroes of the financial market like everyone else they're driven by their own self-interest but by and large their actions have made the market much more efficient a stock market just a place where people get together trying to guess the value for a company people should be allowed to bet on both directions in the end the real bad guys are not the short sellers or the retail investors it is ignorance and wishful thinking as they're all part of human nature as long as the free market exists there will always be boom and bust [Music] you"

was no exception the military found out that munger possessed an extraordinary iq he was then assigned to serve as a meteorologist working on analyzing weather patterns for the war it was a very empirical science in those days we just made weather maps which laid out the weather on the map and then we stacked up those maps and by looking as one followed another you could see whether weather systems were moving and that's the way we were predicting the weather while taking physics course to prepare for his deployment he learned to think like a physicist physicists like to think in terms of fundamentals they're very cautious about their assumptions surprisingly this is very similar to buffett and munger's way of thinking they seem to stick to business fundamentals and logic during the military service charlie munger got married and right after the service he enrolled in harvard law school father had gone to the harvard law school so that was a natural course of activity for me after graduating he was admitted to california bar in 1949 i had an army of children almost immediately i painted myself in quite a corner charlie started at a salary of 275 a month which was above average at the time charlie munger felt well off things seemed to have worked out for him but little did he know he was entering into the darkest period of his life many young men in those days charlie munger married early divorce in 1950s was still frowned upon as a marriage ended with his first wife margaret wanted to minimize the damage it had caused to their children just as monger was healing for his divorce tragedy struck again his son teddy monger was diagnosed with leukemia in those days it was a death sentence [Music] after teddy's passing monger came to realize that he has spent all his savings on teddy's medical bills in those days medical insurance was not as widely covered as it is today once again monger was at the crossroads of life he wondered what could have happened if he was wealthy enough to have the best treatment for his son never feel sorry for yourself if your child is dying of cancer don't feel sorry for yourself never ever feel serve yourself charlie munger was more determined than ever to have true wealth for the sake of his family he was about to become the sharpest sword that was ever built [Music] unlike lawyers today practicing law in the 1950s is not the best way to become wealthy he realized to truly become wealthy one has to be a business owner this is oldest trick in the book by and large most of the wealthy people own businesses sometimes more than just one business while doing legal work for a smart transformer manufacturing company and pasadena monger realized that he could take ownership of that company as well and so one day i said well i'm being too damn shy i just about down to the freeway and pasadena i made a u-turn i went back and i walked in and i said well i really like working for you guys just the kind of people i like to be associated with i like to work for and sure enough they had another big problem that i can solve munger put all his savings and even borrowed money to invest in the company but the business struggled early on in order for it to survive monger had to step in and downsized the company that is very much like how private equities operate today they will buy a business turn around and sell it for profit manga consider this company a bad business but he still managed to make a respectable return in the end this experience has taught him a lesson that became the foundation for how he invests he realized that it's so much easier to buy good businesses than trying to fix broken ones i have a habit in life which is i look at it and i observe what works and what doesn't and i've seen so many idiots get rich in easy business naturally i wanted to be an easier business armed with this valuable lesson he was ready to invest in wonderful businesses but what monger didn't know was that he would soon make his first million in real estate [Music] los angeles was on his way to become the second largest city in america [Music] people were moving to l.a at a rate of 3 000 a month it became clear to monger he must not miss this million-dollar opportunity real estate is just a highly leveraged investment but unlike stocks with real estate you have active control that allows you to reduce the risk while advising his client on a real estate project at caltech charlie munger put his own money on the line by owning half of the operation the caltech property sold out quickly generating 400 return for their hundred thousand dollars investment manga didn't stop there he immediately reinvested his money for more projects five real estate projects i did both side by side for a few years and a very few years i had three or four million dollars even to this day charlie munger was very involved in real estate he built monger science center at harvard surprisingly all this time munger was still holding a steady job as a lawyer it goes to show how risk-averse manga really was at that time although the real estate had made monger millions he stopped after just five projects monger now wanted to make money without having to involve too much debt debt is not always bad if you have the education the self-control and the persistence to make smart educated risks then borrowing money could be like playing a very good game of offense manga seized a great opportunity and make millions we see that a lot with millionaires and billionaires they start out by speculating and taking a lot of risks but once they make their first million they start to play a safe by investing instead of speculating using his connections he started an investment company with his friend and a legal client after they bought a seat at a pacific exchange wheeler monger and company's main business was brokerage and market making market making by its name is just about creating a market for buyers and sellers to trade when there are small number of buyers and sellers it may not be possible to buy and sell the product hence the market is illiquid the market maker simply tried to make money for the bid ask spread by providing transactions which creates more liquidity monger realized he could use a profit for the business to invest in other companies he was acting like a true hedge fund manager at that time they bought small companies such as a cart wash machine manufacturer even invested in some cart loans unlike other investors at that time monger's strategy was so concentrated in small growth companies his portfolio was very concentrated in small cap companies as a result his performance was very volatile but over the long term it has much better performance than most people by 1974 when the partnership dissolved it has turned an average annual return of twenty four point three percent making mongers five million dollars remember this is the seventies be a millionaire in the 70s is very different from today [Music] well monger started his investment company in 1962 he also invested in a struggling company run by his friend warren buffett warren buffett followed the investment approach of ben graham which allowed him to build a successful investment partnership but there was a problem and he'd been taught it by ben graham it was hard for him to quit when he was just coining money but he saw the point you couldn't scale that business and it was kind of scrunchy and unpleasant and you're firing people who in the hell wants to do that could i ever tell you about the horrible experience i had at the blue chip redemption center here in california blue chip stamps was a coupon company at the time i happened to be there because i'd saved up ten and two six books to get a blender so when i walked in i had a lot of confidence you you can imagine the peace of mind that comes with having ten and two six books in your purse because it takes time to accumulate stamps and many customers just forget about the stamps this company has struck gold generating 100 million dollars of sales a year by 1970s this is exactly the type of business warren buffett likes the cash flow business like an insurance company they collect a lot of cash upfront warren buffett realized that he could use those cash to invest in other companies december 1963 the department of justice filed an anti-trust action against blue chip stamp and forced the company to offer more shares to the public this is the opportunity monger and buffett have been waiting for they accumulated a controlling position to the company with buffett being the largest shareholder and monger the second the 1970s was the start of many hostile takeovers but buffett and munger were the friendlier ones after making themselves board members buffett and monger quickly gained control in order to invest the excess cash of blue chip stamps we see a chain of takeovers here warren buffett owns about 36 of berkshire hathaway and he used berkshire hathaway as a vehicle to take over other companies and when he does he used the cash from those companies to take over other companies so it's not as simple as stock picking using blue chip stamps cash monger and buff invested in a small candy store in california called see's candies the business is extraordinarily good in a very small niche but we put 25 million dollars into it and it's given us over 2 billion dollars pre-tax income well over 2 billion and we've used it to buy other businesses but initially c's candy's plan of expansion faced a great challenge that buffett didn't quite anticipate the copycats in 1973 russell stovers candies decided to put on a campaign and tried to beat cs candies at his own marketplace they put in stores that looked exactly like seas called mrs stovers facing such a threat the ceo of c's candy's chuck huggins turned to the only person who's capable of handling such a matter charlie munger charlie munga deal with stovers candies with the iron fist my partner charlie margaret doubt that he's you know he says whenever we have a problem you attack it immediately he says announce the prevention is worth a ton of cure and we've seen that time after time he assembled a team of best lawyers and went after stover kennedys like mercenaries they were ready to go to war it worked stover candies got scared and immediately backed off even more no other candy stores dared to do the same after that berkshire hathaway thrived acquiring one company after another including the famous coca-cola deal but neither buffett or munger could anticipate the biggest threat to berkshire hathaway is about to come [Music] the business of berkshire hathaway extremely unique today owns a large number of separate businesses they also have their own subsidiaries if it weren't for mongoose model berkshire hathaway would have had trouble scaling up but it may have reached its limit i mentioned earlier that 1954 was my best year but but i was working with absolutely with peanuts unfortunately and and i think if you work with small sums of money i think there is some chances of people that really do bring something to the game but i think it's very very hard for anybody to identify them and i think that when they work with large funds it gets tougher it's certainly gotten tougher with for us with larger funds and i would make no promise to anybody that we will do better than the s p 500. warren buffett has talked about in the past that this is an advantage that individual investors have over berkshire hathaway that they can invest in things and it'll make a huge difference as opposed to berkshire hathaway so really they have to kind of look for these really big um these really big stocks or big companies to go after and um buffett's also been up been up front about the fact that he you know killed the s p back in the back in the 60s and 70s and she's been a lot tougher since then as a result in the past five years berkshire hathaway has slightly underperformed the market so it's very judgmental and i think that helped me and also helped me that i kept changing my judgments as i learned more and more facts came in both monger and buffet believe the circle of competence they stick to things that they could understand but what it really means is predictability they want to invest in companies where they can confidently predict what will happen in the future recently munger and buffett decided to expand their circle of competence by investing with apple and amazon i'm overjoyed i'm thrilled uh because uh warren is focused on the long term and and so there is we're in sync it's the way we run the company it's the way he invests and uh yeah so i could not be happier well i think they start to realize that these tech companies start to behave like the kind of company that they like with predictable cash flows and emote around them mongers concentrated small cap investment style is hard for the human psyche but it's the best investment style for retail investors if you invest in any large caps you're facing competitions from institutions who probably have done much better research than you did over the course of his long life monger perhaps has gathered more lessons and experiences than anyone like a theoretical physicist he thinks about business in terms of first principles he just analyzed what would work and what wouldn't and why it's so simple manga's life has been legendary he went through multiple economic recessions he went to war he suffered from the worst tragedy but he never yielded he deal with whatever life has to offer and by doing so becoming one of the most iconic figures in business well luckily i got at a very early age the idea that the safest way to try and get what you want is to try and deserve what you want it's such a simple idea it's the golden rule so to speak you you want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end there is no ethos in my opinion that is better for any lawyer or any other person to i can have your soul i can promise forever [Music] [Music] again [Music] me"

    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulmq6I8aH40",
    "content": "[Music] it's just one of the most impressive stories on wall street he's the founder and ceo of citadel it's one of the largest alternative asset managers and security dealers in the world it's been a big month for citadel's ken griffin in real estate hedge fund manager purchasing another home this week only the most expensive one ever sold in the u.s just off of central park [Music] citadel is among the most successful hedge funds today ken griffin's 30 billion citadel gained 19.4 last year this is beating out a whole host of other of its rivals that is about 6.6 billion dollars in profit at the same time in 2019 netflix total revenue was 6.4 billion dollars there are many breeds of hedge fund managers they're the samurais who don't strike often but rarely miss when they do there are the machines who ruthlessly dig up any traces of profits big or small ken griffin is a builder of machines so griffin started as a quant but he really doesn't care about any particular strategy all he wanted was to build a financial company that does whatever it takes to make money [Music] the son of a project manager for general electric griffin had a passion for mathematics and technology i was incredibly fortunate my my father was first generation to go to college he was one of seven my grandfather worked on the railroads my parents always placed great importance in education in high school he learned computer programming and got a job for ibm we see that ken griffin achieved success at a very young age just like a lot of tech entrepreneurs they started learning to code before computers became popular it was a competitive advantage for people like ken griffin at that time you know the thing about people of bill gates generation was that they were getting their 10 000 hours in in a discipline before the rest of the world realized that that was the discipline that mattered right griffin was also a natural entrepreneur in 1986 while barely an 18 year old he came out with the idea of selling educational software to schools he launched a company called discovery educational systems a few years later griffin sold out his i made a tidy sum the company is still in business at west palm beach today at this particular point of ken griffin's life we see all the characteristics of a tech entrepreneur he was smart he knew how to code and he came from a wealthy family that gave him a safety net being smart kid griffin never had any doubt about getting into a great college my entire professional career working on probability in the dark ages of using a typewriter i typed out about 13 different college applications i'll get into one of them hopefully the best i can into in college griffin just choose to pursue whatever interested him the most after reading an article arguing that the shares of home shopping network were overpriced he purchased put options on the stock hoping to profit from the decline options are derivative contracts that behave like insurance policies a call option gives you an insurance to buy stock at a fixed price before a certain date a put option contract gives you an insurance to sell the stock at a fixed price before a certain date take some time to wrap your head around how options work but griffin figured out as a freshman college that you could short a stock by purchasing a put option and i made a few thousand dollars which as a college freshman that is all the money in the world griffin was hooked he realized that there's so much more to learn about the derivatives i used to walk across the river to harvard business school where i'd spend hours in the library reading books on derivatives and trying to understand the pricing and financial theory behind derivatives he then came across a book that completely changed his life this book is called beat the market written by quan legend edward thorpe at thorb is perhaps the very first well-known quant to give an idea his influence he invented car counting in blackjack after figuring out you could use probability theory to beat the dealers at casinos it quickly became obvious to thorpe that you could do the same to the financial market he independently discovered the black scholes model perhaps before even the authors did well i had come across on my own a formula that became famous quite later the so-called black shoals formula and i had come across it by a rather different methodology i didn't have it i didn't have as tight a proof as they did but i knew it was right and my method was really strong so i was able to solve all kinds of problems in derivatives and derivative hedging before wall street could solve them using his pricing model ken griffin discovered that there are many mispricing opportunities with convertible bonds you're buying a convertible bond and you're shorting the company's stock against it to try to create an equal return whether the stock goes up or the stock goes down then one of the nice parts about it is as the stock continues to climb your sensitivity or what's often called delta of the convertible tends to rise with it the key is to have a proper pricing model for the convertible bond being a proficient coder ken griffin wrote a software program to flag ms price bonds to get more up-to-date information he installed a satellite dish on top of the dorm the supervisor of the building gave me permission to put a satellite dish on top of the building so that i could have real-time stock quotes griffin was definitely a smart kid in college but he also had an incredible amount of good luck and this is how he found his first investment griffin was passionately explaining his trading strategy to his friend in college a wealthy retiree overheard their conversation immediately decided to give him 50 grand for investment in the summer between freshman and sophomore year ken griffin raised 265 000 for relatives and friends to start his very first hedge fund called convertible hedge fund his strategy was similar to thorp's delta hedging strategy delta is the relationship between a change of price of a derivative and its underlying asset for a put option when asset goes up in price the price of the put goes down the delta tells you how much it changes beginning sophomore year griffin quickly started his investment operation mostly buying under press warrants and hedging the positions by shorting the stocks now i'm in boston i'm a kid in college i'm pretty resourceful i called a broker at first boston to ask for advice on this strategy that i came across and this gentleman doug steiner was quite generous with his time they said look this is really not a strategy that our clients do but the firm does it with its with our own money if this is good enough for the firm's money this is what i want to do with my money this is the year of 1987. for those of you that lived through that time there was something major happened in that year the black monday good evening today is black monday the day the dow dropped more than 500 points the day the dow dropped more than 22 percent almost double the rate of the black monday that signaled the beginning of the crash of 1929. luck once again favored ken griffin on october 19 as the stock market crashed griffin's short positions hit the jackpot rising so much higher than the losses on his warrants the pros on wall street were getting slaughtered while this kid running his hedge fund in his dorm room had come up on top shortly before griffin graduated from harvard with a degree in economics it became obvious to him that he needed to raise more money unlike a typical computer nerd ken griffin was really good at networking raising capital for any investment fund is a hard business of itself ken griffin got access to frank mayer a famous quan investor at that time also a partner to add thorpe's hedge fund frank was the co-founder of glenwood partners based here in our great city he was also a pioneer investor in hedge funds and he offered me an opportunity to come to chicago and to join him at glenwood it was a pretty simple proposition i could manage a small pool of capital for glenwood if i did well i could leave i could start my own firm he'd be my partner in doing so impressed by griffin's ability mayor given one million dollars to trade superseding mayor's expectations griffin posted a whopping 70 return in one year so mayor found out that this kid was legit so he decided to help him set up a real hedge fund i guess you could say that ken griffin didn't really start his hedge fund it was mayor and his influence and money that launched citadel by 1990 it was the start of a golden decade for the hedge fund industry and ken griffin more than anyone was ready to build the most feared money machine in all of finance as citadel grew griffin's wealth skyrocketed most of the hedge funds follow a 220 fee structure they take two percent of the asset under management and twenty percent of the profit and this is how money managers make money they either perform very well or raise a lot of money sometimes they don't happen at the same time you know to the layman it's not a paycheck they're getting at the end of the year it is their cut of the fees based on their ownership in the firm and also the amount of money they have invested in their funds that is that is growing or shrink having more money than virtually anyone ken griffin decided to become the most cliche billionaire he marries beautiful french woman he spends hundreds of millions of dollars on art collections and he buys the most expensive real estate in every state he lives in [Music] although started as a quant fund ken griffin didn't want to stop there don't focus on just a single investment strategy focus on building a firm a platform that attracts the best and brightest people to do that griffin was increasingly becoming a ruthless leader he was a big admirer of jack welch who was known for laying off the bottom 10 percent of employees you evaluate people on the on one axis on behaviors and one axis on numbers this approach is quite different from jim simon's management style instead of firing 10 of your employees jim simons was able to spot talents early on nurture them and let them grow citadel started as a kwan fund but griffin discovered that there is money to be made in the fundamental trading business so the core of our business our biggest business is what i refer to as just good old-fashioned stock picking single large driver revenues at citadel is our team of 90 equity portfolio managers organized by industry specialty who understand the businesses that they invest in cold they do everything ken griffin really builds up citadel as this investment powerhouse you can imagine it as a gold mining machine that would take up any trace of gold in 2020 griffins is the 34th richest american according to forbes but in terms of spinning power i would say ken griffin is probably richer than non-hedge fund billionaires because a lot of them have their money tied up in one or two stocks people like jim simons and ken griffin can put up billions of dollars of cash very quickly with all the success and good luck griffin still had his struggles in 2008 citadel almost went under i'll make it very clear i would go home on a friday if morgan stanley did not open for business on monday i would be done by wednesday and if you remember morgan stanley the question was with the japanese follow through on their financing commitment and their very existence was in question so you quickly come to terms with the fact that we may not survive one common factor i found among the successful hedge fund managers besides being incredibly smart they have about the strongest willpower that you can find in human beings that's the one thing we really seek out because i'll tell you what determination persistence almost always wins the day you"

    "title": "Renaissance Technologies - Trading Strategies Revealed | A Documentary",
    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lji-jNsXmAM",
    "content": "Renaissance Technologies is the most profitable \nhedge fund in history. This is probably the single   most successful hedge fund in the history of the \nindustry in terms of its performance record. Right   so you gotta remember he charges a lot but \num before fee is 66 on average since 1988.   Behind the firm's wild success are a series of \nmathematical models and powerful computers. The   quantitative models at Renaissance Technologies \nare constantly being updated but what's more   important than those models are the ways and \nmethods that are used to discover trading signals Jim Simons the founder of Renaissance Technologies \nis a legendary mathematician. He pioneered   a unique way of research and model building to \nthe world of hedge funds. He's worth 21 billion   dollars making him the highest earning hedge fund \nmanager in the world. Born and raised in Brookline   Massachusetts Jim Simons always knew that he \nwanted to be a mathematician. We used to go to a   a delicatessen late at night when I was a student \nand one day I saw Ambrose and Singer come in   late at night and they were obviously doing \nmathematics and I saw this on a number of   occasions and I thought boy that's that's the \ngreatest job in the world! When you can just   hang out and hang out at a delicatessen and do \nmathematics. Simons' enrolled in MIT and even   skipped the first year of mathematics thanks to \nadvanced placement courses he took in high school.   Simons' academic career was very smooth and after \nearning his PHD he quickly became a professor of   math and also took a job as a cold war code \nbreaker. But he yearns for more, particularly   more money! Growing up in a middle-class \nfamily Simons' always wanted to get rich.   Unlike other people in the academics who don't \nreally care about money Simons' on the other hand   knew exactly how to make money - start businesses. \nWhile still at school he started a business with   his south American classmates they decided to \nstart a factory to produce vinyl floor tile   and PVC piping. Well I met some I made \nfriends at MIT with two Colombian boys   and they at a certain point started a business and \nin fact it was my encouragement that they started   that business and my father and I invested a \nsmall amount uh in that business which turned out   eventually uh to be a big success. This is a story \nof James Simons that a lot of people don't hear   about so he took some time off to run the business \nat first but as soon as the business takes off   he immediately delegated responsibilities to \nother people and we saw that time and time again   with the story of RenTech but Simons' had to focus \non his academic career in 1976 at the age of 37   Simons was awarded the American mathematical \nsociety's Oswald Viblen price in geometry   this price is the highest you can get in \nmathematics it's the equivalence of Nobel prize   conquering one summit Simons was looking for \na new mountain to climb in 1974 the floor tile   company Simons' had started with his friends \nsold a 50 stake delivering profits to Simons   and other owners Simons and his classmates made \na lot of money from this business he said let's   invest in the money so Simons knew a student of \nhis who was running a hedge fund by the name of   Charlie Fratfeld superseding Simons' wildest \nexpectations he 10 x their original investment   making them six million dollars total this is \na moment Simons realizes the best way to make   money is with finance he was wondering can I do \nthe same in 1978 Simons left academia to start   his own investment firm with the money he saved \nand from his friends he started money metrics for years after starting money metrics Simons' \nrelied on intuition and fundamentals to trade it   was a great time to be in finance the fund is \ndoing so well he didn't really have to change   his approach but in the back of his mind \nhe was wondering can he use the mathematics   to model asset prices but Simons was getting \ntired of the fundamental trading we did very well   but it was a gut wrenching experience you know \nit's you know one day you walk in and you think   you're a genius god all my positions are in my \nway look up and the next day you walk in and   they're against you and you feel here you're a \ndope how could I have done what I did and so on   there was no rhyme or reason it was just you \nknow you put your finger in the air and you   try to sense which way the the wind is blowing \nSimons' quickly started working on his first model   with the help of his colleague Lenny Baum they \nbuilt a simple mean reversion model buy currencies   if they moved a certain level below their recent \ntrend line and sell if they veer too far above it   the idea of meat reversion is very simple suppose \nyou're a farmer and the average price of corn is   five dollars a bushel now some days it may \nbe six dollars a bushel other days it may   be three dollars a bushel but in the long run \nthese prices will revert back to the mean value   this is what's called mean reversion back in \nthe 80s many commodities were priced like this   now his model would not work today but back \nin the 80s this was a revolutionary idea   they quickly expanded the strategy beyond currency \ntrading by 1982 he changed the company's name to   Renaissance Technologies but soon enough their \nsimple mean reversion strategy started to fail   simple mean reversion is not sufficient anymore \nas other competitors started to build their models   to stay ahead of the game Simons' had to hire more \ntalents this is what really separates gm Simons   apart from other hedge fund managers when he sees \na problem he knows exactly who will be able to   solve it he immediately brought another renowned \nmathematician jim x to develop a new strategy   when Jim Axe looked at those asset prices \nhe noticed that it is a stochastic process   which is also called a random process and he \nbelieved that using mathematical representation   is the best way to model those stochastic process \nwhen people hear about the word random they think   that it's not predictable but that's not the \ncase in mathematics suppose you threw a dice   and you know each site will come up with a \nprobability and you can bet on those probabilities   to model the stochastic process they started \nusing machine learning machine learning is such   a buzzword today but in the 1980s most of hedge \nfund managers don't even know what that means and   they still use their gut to trade but here's the \nRenaissance Technologies ahead of everybody else   already started to use machine learning the \nstyle of machine learning that Ren Tech used   was the kernel method the kernel used a \nclass of algorithms to do pattern analysis   the main tool used in academic finance is linear \nregression to this day linear regression is used   to build forecasting models but the problem is the \nmovement of asset prices is non-linear so rather   than use linear regression Ren Tech decided to \nbuild non-linear models to predict price movements   Simons' at the time was proposing building \nan early machine learning system this model   would generate predictions for various commodity \nprices based on complex patterns clusters and   correlations that'd be very hard for the naked eye \nto see once again they were so ahead of their time   this kernel was like a black box that suggested \ntrades that people couldn't even understand when   the team started testing the model they quickly \nsee great returns the firm began incorporating   hard dimensional kernel regression approaches \nhigher dimensional kernels work best for trending   models they're great at predicting how long a \ntrend will last at this point Simons have put   up millions to this automated trading system \nthey call it the medallion fund the Simons saw   more potential improvement he started investing \nheavily in bringing more mathematical talents with   the gen x model renaissance technology started \nto combine trend following with main reversion the model has generated about 20 annual returns \nwhich is a great performance considering most of   the hedge funds made less than 12 percent the \nSimons' wanted better he brought out another   brilliant mathematician Ellyn Berlekamp \nEllyn Berlekamp’s specialty was game and   information theory he immediately suggested \nto focus on shorter term traits to reduce risk   by going in and out quickly Simons took his advice \nand started focusing on shorter term approach   they do a very different approach it's \nall patterns it's all short term it's not   high frequency but it's something very distinct \nfrom what everybody else is doing now Berlekamp   became fully in charge of the medallion fund he \nstarted fully implementing his ideas he argued   they should learn to handle trades like casinos \na casino doesn't care about any particular bet   even if you win like 10 times a casino is happy \nbecause it knows that in the long run the casino   has the statistical advantage this is what's \ncalled the law of large numbers I think what   Ren Tech adopted was the kelly criterion this \nis what we call the scientific gambling method   to put it simply it's your bet should be \nproportional to how confidence you are in your bet   the formula is your expected net winnings divided \nby your net winnings if you win I think this   is actually the secret sauce for Renaissance \nTechnologies they utilize massive compute power   combined with the scientific approach \nand to discover trading patterns and   validate them and trade based on them they \nkeep collecting uh the patterns and anomalies   and that's how they stay ahead of the game well \nany one anomaly might be a random thing however   if you have enough data you can tell that it's not \nso you can see an anomaly that's persisted for a   sufficiently long time so that the probability \nof it being uh random is is not high but these   things fade after a while anomalies can get washed \nout so you have to keep on top of the business   the firm implemented its new approach in late 1989 \nwhere the 27 million dollars Simons have put up   the results were almost immediate and startling \nthey did more trading than ever cutting medallions   average holding time to just a day and a half \nand from a week and a half scoring profits almost   every day the medallion scored a gain of 55.9 \npercent in 1990 the incredible streak has begun Simons' personal wealth sword he's never \nhesitant to pay his employee a lot of money   so Jim Simons has bought a yacht every year \nhe would bring his employees on his yacht to   all the luxurious places in \nthe world you can imagine Simons' wanted to have more money to make real \nchanges to the world he needed to expand his   hedge fund business even more the only way to \ndo that was getting into the equity business   so far the medallion fund has been very \nsuccessful at trading commodities but it   was capped at 10 billion dollars till this day so \nwhen a hedge fund gets big every trade it makes   gets bigger so we have a big trade like \nthat it takes a long time for it to   execute in the marketplace suppose you're \ntrying to buy 10 million shares of apple   it's going to take a while for the market to \nfill that order and by the time the orders are   filled you might not actually get the price \nyou originally planned and warren buffet is   having the same problem that's why he's saying \nthat he's looking for elephants now because   the amount of stocks that he can have are so \nfew nowadays they created a similar model to   trade equities but it fails to deliver great \nreturns Simons again knew exactly what to do   he hired two top scientists from IBM and \nstarted tasking them with creating equity models   peter brown and Robert mercer were experts \nin natural language processing it took them   more than two years to solve this problem \nwhile their equity models kept losing money   they discovered the reason why the mean \nreversion models don't perform as well   is due to the execution of the trade their equity \nmodels were great at picking out best correctly   but they were too unrealistic with the execution \nof those trades such as market impact and slippage   so if you treat any stocks you immediately \nrealize that you do not get the market price   all the time this is the problem with the academia \nso whatever paper you read they always assume that   you can get the market price but the market \nis a group of buyers and sellers constantly   negotiating prices and if you participate \nin that market you do not always get the uh   the market price brown and mercer realized that \ntheir strategy needs to model this aspect as well   and minimize their trading cost once they solve \nthe problem Ren Tech has entered into a new age   Jim Simons went on a capital raised roadshow and \nexpected its asset under management to the next   level by 2000 the firm was managing 6 billion \nwith 140 employees and the rest is history   by 2020 Simons' retired from Ren Tech that year he \nmade over 1 billion dollars what really separates   Jim Simons apart is his ability to hire talents \nand to create an environment that the smartest   people in the world utilize the maximum potential \nand more importantly James Simons insisted on   using the scientific method to discover patterns \nand anomalies instead of using the gut intuition   it's an open atmosphere everybody \nknows what everybody else is doing   and every every week there's a research \nmeeting if you've had a good idea that you   you think it's going to go somewhere you \npresent it if it looks good it goes to a   small meeting people vet it more carefully but \nthere aren't little groups working in the dark   oh this is my little system and I want you to \nuse it so and that's the best way to do science   I think since Simons' left the firm Ren Tech \nhas still been beating the market consistently   the fun is so successful almost to a mythical \nlevel but as we now see there is no mystery   behind the firm's success is Jim Simons' ability \nto gather talents and also his will to succeed   don't give up I mean now   sometimes is discretion is the better part of \nvalor and you can just say the hell with it but uh   and go on to something else and that's a decision \nthat we've all made at one time or another but uh   persistence has a lot of value and something \nthat's really worthwhile can take a lot of time to   come to fruition and you ought to have patience uh \nif you believe in something to uh to stick with it"

    "title": "Ghost Patterns – D.E. Shaw’s Quant Strategy Explained",
    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK7dETASXsc",
    "content": "this hedge fund is a pioneer in quantitative investing d.e shaw is a firm that all quants are dying to get into managing 50 billion dollars dee shao is instrumental in creating the quant industry that now owns one third of all the u.s stock market for disha their composite fund which has been close to new investors is up more than ten percent that's beating the hedge fund average around eight percent but these days investors are happy if they see a double-digit return in the late 80s and early 90s many scientists and engineers have entered into the hedge fund industry they approach the market in a different way than economists economists believe that the market is efficient but mathematicians at ge shaw discover a lot of patterns that are not explained by economic logic there are statistical anomalies that are not random these are called ghost patterns they have made billions of dollars for quant firms like t.e shaw and renaissance technologies [Music] after earning his phd from stanford morgan stanley hired davi e shaw to create a computer system to support its quantitative trading morgan stanley at the time has a secretive analytical proprietary trading unit that ran a computerized effort to profit from short-run liquidity effects in stock markets the liquidity effect is a type of pattern that many quant firms tried to exploit in early 70s a hedge fund manager michael steinhardt discovered that a big sale order from a pension fund could push the stock price out of line provided that there were no information behind the sale economists always like to assume that all trading is between informed traders and liquidity providers so that means that if i have some information about a stock i will trade on it and then the market price will adjust according to this information i have and then the liquidity providers will also make a small amount of money for providing that transaction but michael steinhardt discovered that sometimes big transactions happen not because it was reacting to bad news but because the seller needed cash this is called the liquidity effect steinhardt could profit by buying and holding the stock until it rose back to its previous level morgan stanley's analytical proprietary trading unit aimed to find more trading signals like this with the advanced computational techniques but it became obvious to shaw that these patterns were often fading away too fast because they were easily caught on by others another example of these patterns is back in the 80s many commodity traders like to liquidate their positions before the market closed because they felt better holding on to cash at night the next day they would build up their portfolio back up again this behavior can be exploited you can buy their positions at night and then resell them the next day simple patterns like this are discovered because they have behavioral explanations shalt believed patterns that are difficult or impossible to explain are more valuable because others are less likely to discover and exploit them this approach is vastly different from morgan stanley who still operated like the academia we often see in academic finance they start out by having a lot of assumptions then they create a theory and then they look for data that justify that theory shell believed that this is not how real science is done the word theory means something different in science and it means something that's been very well tested quantum theory you know the the theory of gravity i mean you know gravity is there and the fact that it's a theory that means that we've tested these ideas over and over again finance people write down very complicated models and they're useful to think about but there isn't a correct one de shaw began investing in june 1989 having secured 28 million dollars in capital from a group of private investors the ghosts that shaw discovered were hard to explain when he found recurring patterns and printed them out there were no familiar terms that could be used to make sense of the anomaly a lot of people assume that quantz funds like dd shaw use high frequency trading but that's not the case they don't need to trade in milliseconds their advantage is these patterns they discovered instead of rely on speed pretty soon the profits started to roll in and shaw quickly expanded the firm to a much larger scale after finding profitable strategies and equities d e shaw discovered that there are more anomalies and derivatives in early 90s a group of economists started a hedge fund called long-term capital management company to exploit some inefficiencies in the derivatives market in a few years it has made around 40 percent annualized returns but failed catastrophically in the end they were valued at about 4.8 billion and this all took place in the weeks following russia's currency devaluation and bond default the federal reserve had to orchestrate a 3.6 billion bailout by the fund's 14 banks in order to calm fears that the firm's lenders and trading partners would be dragged down again these economists that manage this hedge fund made a fatal error that most of academic finance makes assuming a normal distribution simply put they underestimate the likelihood of rare events when it did happened it wiped out the entire fund and almost took down the financial sector with it shaw sought his chance his mathematicians were better at modeling than other market players without assuming normal distribution shaw's team came up with the options pricing model that gave him an edge in multiple markets by now shell had created a machine to discover anomalies in stock prices and derivatives some of strategies produce over 40 returns a year i think robert mercer who was the ceo of renaissance technologies summarizes the best when he says some signals that make no intuitive sense do indeed work the signals that we have been trading without interruption for 15 years make no sense otherwise someone else would have found them now the question is can some solo trader discover signals like this and profit from them professor marcos lupus de prato was managing a quad fund with about 10 billion typically what you want to do is you want to spend a lot of time identifying what are the features that are important for that strategy and once you come up with important features now you're going to build a strategy and at the last moment you're going to backtest you you want to spend most of your time in future importance a lot of people who do technical trading believe that they found some patterns but oftentimes they don't know much about statistical tests to validate those patterns they simply look at charge and try to you know make sense of these these things so i think what's important is to learn how to do statistical tests and for those of you who know mathematics and coding i think it's worth a try [Music] you"

    "content": "he runs the largest hedge fund in the world ray dalio is one of the most successful influential people alive he's returned more to his investors than anyone else in this space which would be amazing under any circumstance but becomes even more dazzling when you consider the fact that he started out as just another middle class kid from long island throughout his career he developed a unique view of how the world works it puts lessons out there for everyone to learn it's one thing when you're an economist in the college or university it's completely different when you have to bet your own money on your research i would choose to listen to retaliate any time of the day because he has skin in the game when dalio talks the world listens his advice and wisdom is eagerly sought on financial matters and economic matters by policymakers around the world in his pursuit of understanding how the economy works he became one of the richest people in the world worth 16.9 billion dollars ray dalio has led a successful life and career after retiring from bridgewater he has been sharing his principles of success regalia is someone who has a lot of dreams and ambitions but he's very realistic in terms of how to achieve his dreams with that mentality ray dalio managed to build a consulting business and made his first million all before the age of 30. born in new york dalia was a natural entrepreneur the world of finance fascinated him i got hooked on the markets when i was 12. well the first stock i bought uh i bought because it was the only company i ever heard of that was selling for less than five dollars this year and it worked and it worked because this company was about to go broke and somebody came along and acquired it then decided that i would be involved in the markets and this game is anything that easy he taught himself how to sell short and by the time he was in high school he had already created a stock portfolio worth several thousand dollars dalio thrived in college he did so well after graduating he got accepted to harvard business school although dalio flourished in business school he wanted to have more real real-world practice in 1972 the summer between dallas two years at business school he became an intern at merrill lynch as a commodity trader commodities in 1970s have very low margin requirements and relatively obscure it's kind of like cryptocurrencies today there's a lot of volatility and a lot of speculators in the space of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interest of the united states on august 15 1971 president richard nixon announced the u.s was stopped using gold standard to control inflation the breakdown of the monetary system in 1971 pushed commodity prices higher and created the first oil shock in 1973 to combat inflation the federal reserve tight monetary policy which brought the worst bearing market since the great depression more than ever dahlia wanted to take part in the commodity trading business after graduating from harvard he got a job at shiraz and hayden stone as a commodity trader at shearson dahlia was in charge of the hedging business advising clients on how to hedge their business risks hedging seems to be hard to understand for people who don't know anything about finance but it's actually a simple concept it's just like buying a insurance contract in commodities you can buy a contract that says you can buy say soybeans for ten dollars per unit in three months from now this will give you peace of mind because you don't have to worry about the fluctuations of soybean prices with this contract but dallas career was short-lived he was fired after having a drunken argument with his boss on new year's eve in 1974. it didn't last long okay so cheers okay so and that's how i started the firm in 1974 redallio started his company in his two-bedroom apartment in manhattan on new year's day he called it the bridgewater his business model was simple he would do his best to study the commodity market then share his insights with his clients in the late 1970s many american businesses started their global expansion as a result they exposed themselves to various currency and commodity risks dalio understood currencies interest rates and commodities while working at shearson dahlia has built a strong relationship with their clients who now continue to pay dalio for his advice that's how i started the firm because i was uh because the client still wanted to do business one year dalio built a reputation for quality research on macroeconomics he published his thoughts and daily observations his newsletter at that time it became widely read by corporate executives policymakers and central bankers around the world in a way ray dalio was a content marketer even to this day if you look at his social media he consistently publishes his findings to the world he understood the power of personal brand before the term even existed soon dalio has attracted a following of powerful players in business one of them was mcdonald he created a hedging strategy for mcdonald to minimize its exposure to volatility of chicken prices this allowed mcdonald to keep a stable price for the chicken mcnuggets dalio was content with his consulting business because it allows him to do what he loves the most research on how the economic machine works but in 1985 after benefiting from ray dalloo's advice many times the world bank decided to give dalio 5 million dollars as a test portfolio this is the beginning of radar's career as a money manager so this might surprise a lot of people uh dalio never wanted to build a hedge fund he was just happy doing his research and even to this day if you look at his videos online he seems very down to earth he will go on podcasts and he never comes off as a hedge fund billionaire in the meantime most money managers follow a benchmark say s p 500 to judge how a portfolio performs but ray dalio wanted a portfolio based on pure alphas and then we have what we call our pure alpha strategy because there's a separation between alpha and beta so every most investors make the mistake of separating those two and think that they're going to make money in the market and in this zero-sum game they're probably going to lose money from making those bets so when we talk about returns they can come from two sources the first source is beta this is the type of return where you get from uh the market so if the economy does well you make more returns from beta and the second return type is alpha this is the type of return you get when you have some kind of informational advantage suppose you notice there's more cars parked at walmart parking lot this year than a previous one and you expect that walmart's gonna beat its earnings uh for this quarter and the return to make from this trade is coming from alpha uh it's because you have that uh advantage of the information in probability theory is called independent events pure alpha portfolio is a collection of these independent bets all based on bridgewater's unique understanding of the market better than any other participants this strategy proved to be a success although it doesn't have the best annualized returns it is uniquely uncorrelated to the market proving to be a great alternative investment for investors in 2020 bridgewater has 138 billion dollars under management making it the biggest hedge fund in the world but dalio's ambition was never to become rich rather he views money as a byproduct of his desire to seek truth"
